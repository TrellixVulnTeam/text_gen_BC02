“The Emperor protect you, where you’re going,” Lyntor-Sewq said.
“Thank you, sir.”
“I only asked you here today to give you this.”
He reached into his desk and produced a slim, oblong box covered in gold-flecked blue satin. Lyntor-Sewq
opened it.
A Gold Aquila, pinned to a white silk ribbon, lay in the cushioned interior.
“This is to acknowledge your devoted service to Aexe Cardinal. The Order of the Eagle. The greatest honour it is
in the high sezar’s gift to bestow.”
Gaunt had seen one before, pinned proudly to Iaco Fep Golke’s coat.
