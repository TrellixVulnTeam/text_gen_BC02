 a warhammer 40,000 novel ghostmaker gaunt's ghosts 02 it is the 41st millennium. for more than a hundred centuries the emperor has sat immobile on the golden throne of earth. he is the master of mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. he is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the dark age of technology. he is the carrion lord of the imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die. yet even in his deathless state, the emperor continues his eternal vigilance. mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the emperor's will. vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. greatest amongst his soldiers are the adeptus astartes, the space marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. their comrades in arms are legion: the imperial guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant inquisition and the tech-priests of the adeptus mechanicus to name only a few. but for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse. to be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. it is to live in the cruellest and most bloody regime imaginable. these are the tales of those times. forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. there is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods. inheriting command of the sabbat worlds crusade force from the late and lauded warmaster slaydo, warmaster macaroth renewed the imperial offensive to liberate the sabbat worlds, a cluster of nearly one hundred inhabited systems along the edge of the segmentum pacificus. tomorrow, sir, the transfer shifts begin. why waste the rest of today and tonight? that should be possible. strange place this, this tanith. so they say. corbec, stood by his tent, shielded his eyes against the glare and nodded. need warming up? gaunt? larkin snapped, returning to his obsessive polishing. corbec winked across at bragg and they sipped some more. pack it up, boys. the elector of tanith, the local planetary lord, himself sporting a cheek tattoo of a snake, had assured gaunt of the fighting mettle of the tanith militia. gaunt had nodded politely. now gaunt sat in private in an anteroom of the assembly. he'd slung his greatcoat and his cap on a hardwood chest nearby and sym had laid out his dress jacket for the dinner that would commence in thirty minutes. if only he could rid himself of his headache and of the bad taste in his throat that he had landed a weak command. and the music! the damn pipe music, invading his head even here in the private rooms! he got to his feet and strode to the sloping windows. out beyond the cityscape and the founding fields, orange fire thumped into the twilight as the heavy transports departed and returned, ferrying the regimental components to the vast troop carriers in high orbit. that music still! gaunt walked to a set of dark green velvet drapes and swept them aside. the music stopped. the boy with the small set of pipes looked at his raging eyes in astonishment. he was about seventeen, not yet a man, but tall and well-made. his face, a blue fish tattoo over the left eye, was strong and handsome. his be-ringed fingers clutched a tanith pipe, a spidery clutch of reeds attached to a small bellows bag that was rhythmically squeezed under the arm. gaunt asked. the boy shook his head. gaunt paused. he turned back to the boy. gaunt nodded. on his way out of the door, the boy collided with sym, who was on the way in. the look on sym's face immediately told gaunt that something was very, very wrong. gaunt gathered his senior staff in a small, wood-panelled lobby off the main banqueting hall. most were dressed for the formal function, stiff in gilt collars and cuffs. junior munitorium staff watched the doors, politely barring the entry of any tanith dignitaries. gaunt was pacing, reviewing a data-slate with fierce intensity. sym asked. some of the others nodded as if urging the same question. a munitorium aide said, disbelief in his thin voice. gaunt saw the autopistol in the hand of the other too late. it fired the moment before he ploughed into them. raging, he broke one's jaw with the butt of his bolter, knocking the man backwards to the head of the stairs. he picked up the other and threw him over the stair rail into the smoke below. sym lay in a pool of blood. gaunt snapped, trying to lift him, his hand slick with the man's blood. sym rasped, his voice high with pain. gaunt said. the aide seemed to reach for him, clawing at his tunic. for a second, gaunt though sym was trying to pull himself up so that gaunt could carry him. then sym's torso exploded in a red mist and gaunt was thrown back off his feet. at the head of the stairs, the grotesque shock troops of chaos bayed and advanced. sym had seen them over gaunt's shoulder, had pulled himself up and round to shield gaunt with his own body. gaunt got to his feet. his first shot burst the horned skull of the nearest beast. his second and third tore apart the body of another. his fourth, fifth and sixth gutted two more and sent them spinning back into their comrades behind on the steps. his seventh was a dull clack of dry metal. hurling the spent bolter aside, gaunt backed away towards the silo bay doors. he could smell the rancid scents of chaos over the smoke now, and hear the buzz of the maggot-flies. in a second they would be on him. autocannon fire blasted into the heathen nightmares, sustained heavy fire from an angle nearby. gaunt turned, and saw the boy, the piper with the fish tattoo. he was laying down an arc of covering fire from the portico of the silo bay with a sentry's autocannon that he had rested across the stonework. cried the boy. gaunt threw himself through the bay doors into the fierce whirlwind of the cutter's engine backwash. the side hatch was just closing and he scrambled through, losing the tails of his coat to the biting hinge. enemy weapons fire resounded off the hull. the cutter rose from the tower bay hard and fast, lifter jets screaming as they were jammed into overdrive. aerial laser fire exploded the brass orchid-shutters around them and clipped a landing stanchion. hovering, the cutter wobbled. below it, tanith magna was a blazing inferno. forgetting fuel tolerances, flight discipline, even his own mother's name, the pilot hammered the main thrusters to maximum and the cutter fired itself up through the black smoke like a bullet. left to die, the forests burned. gaunt fell against a bulkhead and clawed his way to a porthole. just like in his dreams � fire, like a flower. blossoming. pale, greenish fire, scuttling like it was alive. eating the world, the whole world. ibram gaunt gazed into his reflection, his own lean, pale, bloody face. trees, blazing like the heart of a star, rushed past behind his eyes. high over the cold, mauve, marbled world of nameth, gaunt's ships hung like creatures of the deep marine places. three great troop carriers, their ash-grey, crenellated hulls vaulted like monstrous cathedrals, and the long, muscular escort frigate navarre, spined and blistered with lance weapons and turrets, hooked and angular like a woodwasp, two kilometres long. in his stateroom on the navarre, gaunt reviewed the latest survey intelligence. tanith was lost, part of a conquered wedge of six planet systems that fell to the chaos armada pincer which macaroth had allowed to slip behind his over-eager war-front. now crusade forces were doubling back and re-engaging the surprise enemy. sporadic reports had come in of a thirty-six hour deep-space engagement of capital ships near the circudus. the imperial crusaders now faced a war on two fronts. gaunt's ruthless retreat had salvaged three and a half thousand fighting men, just over half of the tanith regiments, and most of their equipment. the cruellest, most cynical view could call it a victory of sorts. gaunt slid a data-slate out from under a pile of other documents on his desk and eyed it. it was the transcript of the communiqu� from macaroth himself, applauding gaunt's survival instinct and his great feat in salvaging for the crusade a significant force of men. macaroth had not seen fit to mention the loss of a planet and its population. it made gaunt queasy. he tossed the slate aside. the shutter opened and kreff entered. kreff was the frigate's executive officer, a hard-faced, shaven-headed man in the emerald, tailored uniform of the segmentum pacificus fleet. gaunt asked. he didn't know gaunt and vice versa. it had taken sym four years to get used to the commissar. sym� gaunt asked. kreff hesitated. they want to speak to you.  they came aboard thirty minutes ago. let's know you corbec said. gaunt was impressed. none of them even bothered to acknowledge his rank and seniority. gaunt asked. gaunt gazed out into space. corbec spat. rawne asked. gaunt saw something in the reflection on the glass. rawne, grinned. corbec met his gaze. rawne laughed. the boy stopped as the shutter closed after the two men. and you paid me back. i'm not militia or guard. before milo could answer, the shutter slammed open again and kreff entered, a slate in his hand. he saluted again. distant, rumbling explosions seemed a constant feature of the deadzone on blackshard. the persistent crump of heavy gunnery drummed the low, leaden sky over the ridgeline. an earthwork had been built up along the ridge's spine and, under hardened bunkers, a detachment of imperial guard � six units of the 10th royal sloka � were readying to mobilise. colonel thoren walked the line. the men looked like world-killers in their ornate battledress: crested, enamelled scarlet and silver warsuits built by the artisans of sloka to inspire terror in the enemy. but perhaps not this enemy. general hadrak's orders had been precise, but thoren's heart was heavy. he had no relish for the approaching push. he had no doubt at all it would cost him dearly. to push blind, unsupported, into treacherous unknown territory in the hope of finding a wormhole into the enemy positions that might not even be there. the prospect made him feel sick. thoren's subaltern drew his attention suddenly to the double file of sixty men moving down the covered transit trench towards them. scrawny ruffians, dressed in black, camo-cloaks draped over them, plastered to their bodies by the rain. colonel corbec, 1st tanith. first-and-only. colonel thoren, i presume? my regiment arrived here on blackshard yesterday night, with orders to reinforce general hadrak's efforts to seize the chaos stronghold. thoren nodded. this was gaunt, the upstart colonel-commissar, it had to be. thoren waved up an aide who flipped up a map-projector, and displayed a fuzzy image of the deadzone. gaunt raised a questioning eyebrow. thoren breathed heavily. thoren indicated the map again. thoren asked. thoren nodded. gaunt and corbec withdrew to their men. mad larkin, corbec was sure. first units at the tunnels now. move up close in pairs. a few moment later he was entering the dripping, dark mouth of the rubble tunnel. five chaos-bred warriors in the orange robes of their cult lay dead. before him, the tanith were forming up. corbec was wiping blood from the blade of his long, silver knife. the elector of tanith, may his soul rest, had not lied about anything, gaunt decided. the ghosts had proved their cunning stealth crossing the open waste of the deadzone, and he had no clue as to how they threaded their way through the crazy lightless warren of the tunnels so surely. gaunt suspected that the foe had assumed nothing bigger than a cockroach would ever find its way through those half-collapsed, deathtrap tunnels. but corbec's men had, effortlessly, in scant minutes. rising from the tunnels' ends inside the curtain wall of the city, and taking long, silver tanith knives to pallid, blotchy throats, they had burned their way in through the enemy's hindquarters. now the tanith first-and-only were proving they could fight. just like the elector had said. from behind a shattered pillar, gaunt blasted with his bolter, blowing two cultists apart and destroying a doorway. around him, the advancing tanith lacerated the air with precise shots from five dozen lasguns. near to gaunt, a sharp-faced, older tanith gaunt had heard the men call larkin was sniping cultists off the top of the nearest balconies. his eye was tremendous. a little further on, a huge man, a gentle giant called bragg, was shouldering the heavy bolter and taking down walls and columns. the big weapon had originally been pintlemounted on a sled, but bragg had torn it off its mount and slung it up like a rifle. gaunt had never seen a heavy bolter carried by an unarmoured man before. he was a terrible shot, admittedly, but with firepower like that he could afford to be sloppy. corbec radioed to gaunt. gaunt acknowledged. he would move more teams up. creeping down the aisle of the massive temple, corbec edged through rubble and heavy crossfire. he nodded a pair past him � rawne and suth � and then the next. his own cover partner, forgal, bellied up close in the mica dust of the temple floor and unslung his lasgun. corbec howled and opened up in rage, bringing the entire stained glass window down in a sheet onto the altar. rawne and suth took advantage of the confusion to grab a few more yards. rawne unwrapped a tube-charge and hurled it over-arm into the archway. the blast was deafening. he scrambled into the smoky interior of the temple. gaunt entered the chapel, mashing broken glass under foot. he could smell the stink. corbec and rawne were waiting for him, their other men stood around, watching with lasguns ready. gaunt slammed fresh rounds home into his boltgun, then holstered it and picked up forgal's fallen las-gun. beneath the chapel was an undercroft. dead cultists were strewn like rag dolls around the smouldering floor. in the centre of the chamber stood a rusty, metallic box, two metres square, its lid etched with twisted sigils of chaos. gaunt reached out. the metal was warm. it pulsed. he snatched his hand back. asked corbec. within minutes, the ghosts had withdrawn. rawne crouched and connected the firing pins of the small but potent anti-personnel charges. a fitting place for scum like you to die, ghost maker! rawne drew his laspistol and lowered it towards gaunt's head. gaunt kicked out and brought rawne down. he rolled and slammed into him, punching him once, twice. blood marked rawne's mouth. he tried to hit again but gaunt was so much bigger. he struck rawne so hard he was afraid he'd broken his neck. the tanith lolled in the dust. gaunt got up, and eyed the timer setting. it was just dropping under two minutes. time to leave. gaunt turned. but in the doorway of the room, the warriors of chaos moved towards him. the blast sent a column of dirt and fire up into the sky that could be seen from the guard trenches across the deadzone. six minutes later, the defenders' big guns stopped and fell silent. then all firing ceased completely from the enemy lines. guard units moved in, cautiously at first. they found the cultists dead at their positions. each one had, in unison, taken his own life, as if in response to some great loss. in the conclusion of his report on the victory at blackshard, general hadrak surmised that the destruction of the chaos relic, which had given meaning to the cult defence, robbed them of the will or need to continue. hadrak also noted the significant role in the victory played by the newly founded tanith 1st, which had supplemented his own forces. colonel-commissar gaunt, wounded in the stomach and shoulder, emerged alive from the deadzone twenty minutes after the blast and was treated by medical teams before returning to his frigate. he might have made his way out of the enemy lines faster, had he not carried the unconscious body of one of his officers, a major rawne, back to safety. stiff with drug-dulled pain, gaunt walked down the companion way of the troop carrier and into the holding bay. nearly nine hundred of the tanith were billeted here. first blood to tanith. the first wound of vengeance. savour it. save the yelling and screaming for battle, ibram. before that comes, build their morale with gentle encouragement. gaunt prided himself on knowing not only the names of all his men, but a little about each of them too. a private joke here, a common interest there. oktar's way, tried and tested , emperor rest his soul these long years. gaunt tried to memorise each muddy, smiling face as he passed along. he knew his soul would be damned the day he was told trooper so-and-so had fallen and he couldn't bring the man's face to mind. let them have their fun while it lasts. how many would be alive to play the game again tomorrow? how many indeed? there were losses and losses. some worthy, some dreadful, and some plain unnecessary. still the memories dogged his mind in these crawling hours of waiting. praise be the emperor that gaunt's losses of brave, common troopers would never be as great, as wholesale or as senseless as that day on voltemand, a year before� two a blooding they were a good two hours into the dark, black-trunked forests of the voltemand mirewoods, tracks churning the filthy ooze and the roar of their engines resonating from the sickly canopy of leaves above, when colonel ortiz saw death. it wore red, and stood in the trees to the right of the track, in plain sight, unmoving, watching his column of basilisks as they passed along the trackway. it was the lack of movement that chilled ortiz. he did a double take, first seeing the figure as they passed it before realising what it was.  almost twice a man's height, frighteningly broad, armour the colour of rusty blood, crested by recurve brass antlers. the face was a graven death's head. daemon. chaos warrior. world eater. ortiz snapped his gaze back to it and felt his blood drain away. he yelled into the set. gears slammed and whined, and hundreds of tons of mechanised steel shuddered, foundered and slithered on the muddy track, penned, trapped, too cumbersome to react quickly. by then the chaos space marine had begun to move. so had its six comrades, each emerging from the woods around them. the ketzok had the firepower to flatten a city, but caught on a strangled trackway, in a thick woodland, with no room to turn or traverse, and with monstrous enemies at close quarters, far too close to bring the main guns to bear, they were all but helpless. panic alarms spread backwards down the straggled column, from convoy portion to portion. ortiz heard tree trunks shatter as some commanders tried to haul their machines off the track. the world eaters started baying as they advanced, wrenching out of their augmented throats deep, inhuman calls that whooped across the trackway and shivered the metal of the tank armour. ortiz ordered. as he spoke, he cranked round the autocannon mounted on his vehicle's rear and angled it at the nearest monster. the killing started. the rasping belch of flamers reached his ears and he heard the screams of men cooking inside their superheated tank hulls. the chaos marine he had first spotted reached the basilisk ahead of his and began to chop its shell like firewood with a chain-axe. sparks blew up from punctured metal. sparks, flames, metal shards, meat. screaming, ortiz trained his mounted gun on the world eater and fired. he shot long at first, but corrected before the monster could turn. the creature didn't seem to feel the first hits. ortiz clenched the trigger and streamed the heavy tracer fire at the red spectre. at last the figure shuddered, convulsed and then blew apart. ortiz cursed. the world eaters soaked up the sort of punishment that would kill a leman russ. he realised his ammo drum was almost empty. he was snapping it free and shouting to his bombardier for a fresh one when the shadow fell on him. ortiz turned. another chaos marine stood on the rear of the basilisk behind him, a giant blocking out the pale sunlight. it stooped, and howled its victory shout into his face, assaulting him with concussive sonic force and wretched odour. ortiz recoiled as if he had been hit by a macro shell. he could not move. the world eater chuckled, a macabre, deep growl from behind the visor, a seismic rumble. the chainsword in its fist whined and swung up� the blow didn't fall. the monster rocked, two or three times, swayed for a moment. and exploded. smeared with grease and ichor, ortiz scrambled up out of his hatch. he was suddenly aware of a whole new layer of gunfire � sustained lasgun blasts, the chatter of support weapons, the crump of grenades. another force was moving out of the woods, crushing the chaos marine ambush hard against the steel flanks of his artillery machines. as ortiz watched, the remaining world eaters died. one was punctured dozens of times by lasgun fire and fell face down into the mire. another was flamed repeatedly as he ripped apart the wreck of a basilisk with his steel hands. the flames touched off the tank's magazine and the marine was incinerated with his victims. his hideous roar lingered long after the white-hot flames had consumed him. the column's saviours emerged from the forest around them. imperial guards: tall, dark-haired, pale-skinned men in black fatigues, a scruffy, straggle-haired mob almost invisible in their patterned camo-cloaks. ortiz heard strange, disturbing pipe music strike up a banshee wail in the close forest, and a victory yelp erupted from the men. it was met by cheers and whoops from his own crews. ortiz leapt down into the mud and approached the imperial guardsmen through the drifting smoke. ortiz nodded back. he found he was still shaking. but that was all. then a shrieking chainsword decapitated him. the heavy, dead parts flopped back into the mud. one of them rolled. he turned to corbec and ortiz as they got up, caked in black filth. ortiz stared at the tall, powerful man in the long dark coat and cap of an imperial commissar. his face was blade thin, his eyes as dark as space. ghosts? sturm nodded, observing his senior adjutant. gilbear � gizhaum danver de banzi haight gilbear, to give him his full name � was the second son of the haight gilbears of solenhofen, the royal house of volpone. he was nearly two and half metres tall and arrogantly powerful, with the big, blunt, bland features and languid, hooded eyes of the aristocracy. gilbear wore the grey and gold uniform of the royal volpone 50th, the so-called bluebloods, who believed they were the noblest regiment in the imperial guard. sturm sat back in his chair. gilbear cocked a disdainful eyebrow. sturm got to his feet and adjusted the sit of his resplendent blueblood staff uniform. the study was bathed in yellow sunlight that streamed in through the conservatory doors at the end, softened by net drapes. he rested his hand on the antique globe of voltemand in its mahogany stand by the desk and span it idly, gazing out across the grounds of vortimor house. this place had been the country seat of one of voltemand's most honoured noble families, a vast, grey manse, fringed with mauve climbing plants, situated in ornamental parkland thirty kilometres south of voltis city. it had been an ideal location to establish his supreme headquarters. outside, on the lawn, a squad of blueblood elite in full battle dress were executing a precision synchronised drill with chainswords. metal flashed and whirled, perfect and poised. beyond them, a garden of trellises and arbours led down to a boating lake, calm and smoky in the afternoon light. navigation lights flashed slowly on the barbed masts of the communications array in the herbarium. somewhere in the stable block, strutting gaudcocks whooped and called. you wouldn't think there was a war on, mused sturm. he wondered where the previous owners of the manse were now. did they make it off world before the first assault? are they huddled and starving in the belly hold of a refugee ship, reduced overnight to a level with their former vassals? or are they bone-ash in the ruins of kosdorf, or on the burning metis road? or did they die screaming and melting at the orbital port when the legions of chaos first fell on their world, vaporised with the very ships they struggled to escape in? who cares? thought sturm. the war is all that matters. the glory, the crusade, the emperor. he would only care for the fallen when the bloody head of chanthar, demagogue of the chaos army that held voltis citadel, was served up to him on a carving dish. and even then, he wouldn't care much. gilbear nodded. sturm managed a small smile. gaunt asked, riding on the top of ortiz's basilisk as the convoy moved on. colonel ortiz nodded, leaning back against the raised top-hatch cover. gaunt removed his cap and ran a hand through his short fair hair. gaunt gazed along the line of the convoy as they moved on, taking in the massive bulk of the basilisks as they ground up the snaking mud-track through the sickly, dim forest. his men were riding on the flanks of the great war machines, a dozen or more per vehicle, joking with the serpent crews, exchanging drinks and smokes, some cleaning weapons or even snoozing as the lurch of the metal beasts allowed. the ghosts are new, unproven but for a skirmish on blackshard. but they have certain� strengths. now gaunt smiled. doranz asked. on the back armour of another basilisk, hulking bragg, the biggest of the ghosts, and small, wiry larkin, were dicing with two of the tank's gun crew. larkin had already won a gold signet ring set with a turquoise skull. bragg had lost all his smokes, and two bottles of sacra. every now and then, the lurch of the tank beneath them would flip the dice, or slide them under an exhaust baffle, prompting groans and accusations of fixing and cheating. up by the top hatch with the vehicle's commander, major rawne watched the game without amusement. the basilisk commander felt uneasy about his passenger. rawne was slender, dark and somehow dangerous. a starburst tattoo covered one eye. he was not� likeable or open like the other ghosts seemed to be. rawne asked, turning slowly to face the serpent. ortiz passed gaunt his flask. the afternoon was going and they were losing the light. in a few moments they had gathered up their kits and weapons and swung down off the skirt armour onto the track. a moment more and they had vanished like smoke into the woods. at pavis crossroads, the serpents spoke. stretching their great painted beaks towards the night sky, they began their vast barrage. brin milo cowered in the shadow of a medical chimera, pressing his hands to his ears. he'd seen two battles up close: the fall of tanith magna and the storming of the citadel on blackshard, but this was the first time he had ever encountered the sheer numbing wrath of armoured artillery. the ketzok basilisks were dug in along the ridge in a straggled line about a mile long. they were hull-down into the grey earth, main weapons swung high, hurling death at the western hills across the valley nine kilometres away. they were firing at will, a sustained barrage that could, corbec had assured him, go on all night. every second at least one gun was sounding, lighting the darkness with its fierce muzzle flash, shaking the ground with its firing and recoil. pavis crossroads was a stone obelisk marking the junction of the metis road that ran up the valley from voltis city, and the mirewood track that carried on towards the east. the serpents' armour had rolled in at nightfall, ousting the encamped bluebloods who held the junction, and deploying around the ridge-line, looking west. as the first stars began to shine, ortiz's men began their onslaught. requested gaunt over the barrage. milo pulled the commissar's brass-capped nightscope from his pack and gaunt stepped up onto the parapet, scanning out of the dugout. corbec leaned up close by him, a thin black tube protruding from his beard. gaunt glanced round. he asked. gaunt flipped his scope shut and jumped down from the parapet, handing the device back to milo. the boy had already set up the field-map, a glass plate in a metal frame mounted like an easel on a brass tripod. gaunt cranked the knurled lever on the side and the glass slowly lit with bluish light. as if for emphasis, the nearest basilisk outside fired and the dugout shook. rawne stepped forward, almost reluctant to be anywhere near gaunt. no one knew what had passed between them when they had been alone together on blackshard, but everyone had seen gaunt carry rawne to safety on his shoulder, despite his own injuries. surely that sort of action bonded men, not deepened their enmity? rawne adjusted a dial on the field-map's edge so that the plate displayed a different section of the chart-slide. gaunt asked. we'll move in squads. one man in every ten will be carrying as much high explosive as he can. squad leaders should select any man with demol experience. we provide cover for these demolition specialists to allow them to set charges that will take out sections of wall or gates. anything that splits the city open. colm corbec heard his commander in the darkness and acknowledged. he waded forward through the reeds to bragg, who had hunkered down behind a rotting jetty. bragg grinned, teeth bright in the starlight. he dragged the canvas cover off one of the two huge weapons he had lugged on his shoulders from pavis crossroads. but the watergate was a big target, and the missile rack held four melta-missiles. the night exploded. three missiles went straight up the throat of the chute. the force of the heat-blast sent stone debris, metal shards, water vapour and body parts out in a radius of fifty yards. the fourth vaporised a chunk of wall, and brought down a small avalanche of basalt chunks. for a moment the heat was so intense that gaunt's nightscope read nothing but emerald glare. then it showed him the chiselled mouth of the watergate had become a bubbling, blazing wound in the huge wall, a ragged, slumping incision in the sheer basalt. he could hear agonised screaming from within the chute. beyond the city wall, alarm bells and sirens rose in pandemonium. the ghosts charged the watergate. orcha led the first squad up the sloping drain-away under the molten arch of ruptured stone. he and three of his men swung flamers in wide arcs, scorching and scouring up unto the darkness of the echoing chute. behind them, corbec brought in fire teams with lasguns who darted down into the side passages and cisterns of the watergate, butchering the cultists who had limped or crawled into cover after the first attack. the third wave went in, under major rawne. in the front rank was bragg, his empty launcher discarded in favour of the heavy bolter that he had liberated from its mounting back on blackshard and now lugged around like a smaller man might heft a heavy rifle. gaunt leapt forward too, bolt pistol in one hand, chain sword in the other. he bellowed after his attacking men, all of them racing silhouettes backlit against the glittering water by fire. up in the chute, orcha and his squad heard the shrill wail of the pipes outside. damp darkness was before them. an assault cannon raged out of the darkness of a side chute. brith, orcha and two others disintegrated instantly into red mist and flesh pulp. caffran yelled into his bead. corbec cursed. corbec didn't answer. he cinched his bayonet onto his lasgun and charged up the slope of the chute, screaming louder and shriller than milo's pipes. in uproar, the ghost squads followed him. caffran and gades joined the charge, bellowing, weapons held low as they splashed out from behind the buttress into the main vault. corbec leapt clear a sandbag line damming one gully and disembowelled the two cultists who were struggling to unjam the assault cannon. larkin dropped down on one knee in the brackish soup and popped the cover on his lasgun's darkscope. carefully selecting his expert long shots, he blasted four cultists further down the chute. las and bolt fire slammed back at the ghosts, dropping several of them. the charging guardsmen met the cultist force head on in a tight, tall sub-chute, no wider than two men abreast. bodies exploded, blasted at close range. bayonets and blades sliced and jabbed. corbec was in the thick of it. already a chain sword had gashed his left hand and cost him a finger, and blood blurted from a slash to his shoulder. he speared a man, but lost his gun when the corpse's weight on the bayonet tore it out of his hands. he ripped out his fallback weapons, a laspistol and his tanith knife of sheer silver. around him in the frenzy, men killed or died in a confined press that was packed in close like a busy work transit, crowded at rush hour. already the water level was rising because of the depth of bodies and body parts in the gully. advancing up the tunnel fifty paces back, gaunt could hear the sheer tumult of the nightmarish close-quarters fight in the chute. he looked down and saw that the trickle of bokore river water that ran down over his boots was thick and red. ten yards further, he found trooper gades, part of orcha's original squad. gaunt bellow, cradling the coughing, gagging gades in his arms. the ghosts will make ghosts tonight. advance! narrow file! with a deafening bellow, gaunt's ghosts charged forward en masse, breaking down into files of three, surging into the throttling entrance to hell. up ahead, in the dark, close, smoky killing zone, rawne slumped against a buttress, splashed in gore, and panted. by his side, larkin squatted and fired shot after shot into the darkness. rawne said. the cultists were everywhere. sergeant cluggan's secondary expedition force poured in through the stinking crypts of the western sanitation outfalls, and the enemy rose to meet them all around. it was hand to hand, each step of the way won by strength and keen blades. the dark, tight confines of the drainage tunnels were lit by the flashes of lasfire, and shots ricocheted from the roof and walls. i'm west of you, sir. on the banks. channel eighty. gaunt crossed to him, adjusting his own setting. the blast was so loud, it almost went beyond sound. the shockwave mashed into them, chopping the water like a white squall. a kilometre away, a hundred metre section of the curtain wall blew out, ripping a vast wound in the city's flank, burning, raw, exposed. the channels went mad with frenzied calls and whoops. gaunt looked on in disbelief. corbec's voice cut through, person to person on the link. gaunt slumped back against a tree bole, up to his waist in the stinking river. around him the men were laughing and cheering. exhaustion swept over him. and then he too began to laugh. general sturm took breakfast at nine. the stewards served him toasted black bread, sausage and coffee. the best, in fact. seems your gamble paid off. these ghost fellows have taken voltis. broken it wide out. our attack units followed them in en masse. gilbear eyed his slate and helped himself to a sausage from the dish. now we thank him. send these orders under extreme encryption to the co. of the ketzok basilisks at pavis. gilbear took the slate. sturm fixed him with a stare. colonel ortiz snatched the radio from his com-officer and yelled. look, sir! men were coming up the metis road out of the valley towards them, tired men, weary men, filthy men, walking slowly, carrying their dead and wounded. all around, shocked, silent basilisk crew were leaping down from their machines and going to meet the battered men, supporting them, helping them, or simply staring in appalled disbelief. ortiz walked over to meet the arrival. he saw the tall figure in the long coat, now ragged, striding wearily out of the mist. ibram gaunt was half-carrying a young ghost whose head was a bloody mess of bandages. gaunt's fist silenced him. colonel-commissar ibram gaunt marched into the study. sturm said. this is war. now this hitting business. chain of command and all that. my hands are tied. it's to be a court martial. if you're going to shoot me for it, get on with it. i struck ortiz in the heat of the moment. in hindsight, i realise he was probably following orders. colonel ortiz has just filed an incident report. gilbear snatched it and read it hastily. sturm snapped. the general glared at gaunt, and gaunt glared right back, unblinking. sturm was lost for words for a moment. he was haunted by the ghost of his missing finger. appropriate, he thought. in the bunk below him, milo squeezed the bladder of his pipes and made them let out a moan, a shrill, sad sigh. it echoed around the vast troop bay of the huge, ancient starship, where a thousand tanith ghosts were billeted in bunks. the dull rhythm of the warp engines seemed to beat in time to the wailing pipes. above him, corbec smiled, remembering the old jig, and the nights he heard it played in the taverns of tanith magna. the energetic skip of the jig began and quickly snaked out across the iron mesh of the deck, between the aisles of bunks, around stacks of kits and camo-cloaks, through the smoky groups where men played cards or drank, over bunks where others slept or secretly gazed at portraits of women and children who were forever lost, and tried to hide their tears. enjoying the tune, corbec looked up from his bunk when he heard footsteps approach down the deck-plates. he jumped up when he saw it was gaunt. corbec said, surprised. sturm mentions our participation with commendations in his report. spat corbec. gaunt bent down and opened the kit-bag he was carrying. he produced a half dozen bottles of sacra. chuckling, corbec pulled a stack of old shot glasses from his kit. cigars, liquorice flavour � for a few minutes. it's only water, but it's cold. gaunt gestured him to a seat. mkoll's battledress and cloak were drenched in wet mud. the powerful, wiry man grimaced noncommittally. mkoll screwed up his mouth and nose. gaunt nodded approval. he liked mkoll, the tanith's finest scout. even in a regiment of stealthers and covert warriors, mkoll was exceptional. a woodsman back home on lost tanith, he had reconnaissance skills that had proved themselves time and again to the ghosts. a ghost amongst ghosts, and modest with it. he never bragged, and it was certain he had more to brag about than most. mkoll looked down at his hands. milo said. three sound and fury all around there was a hushing sound, as if the whole world wanted to silence him. mkoll bellied in low amid the forest of ferns, trying to pick through the oceanic rushing sound they made as the wind stirred them. the fern growth in that part of ramillies 268-43, flourishing on the thin, ashy soils of the longcold volcanic slopes, was feathery and fibrous, mottled stalks rough as cane rising three man-heights into swaying multi-part fronds as white as water-ice. they reminded him of the nal-wood forests back home, when there was still a back home, the nal-woods in winter, when he'd gone out logging and hunting. frost had crusted the evergreen needles on the sighing trees then until they had tinkled like wind chimes. here, now, there was only the sigh, the motion of the dry ferns and the clogging dust that got into every pore and rasped the soft tissue at the back of the throat. the sunlight was bright and harsh, stabbing down through the pale, spare air out of a sky translucent blue. it made a striated web out of the ground cover under the ferns � stark sunsplashes and jagged shadows of blackness. he crept forward twenty metres into a break of skeleton brush. his lower legs were already double-wrapped with chain-cloth to protect against the shredding thorns.  he had his lasgun held to his chest on a tightly cinched strap to keep it clear of the dust but, every ten minutes or so, he checked its moving parts and cleared the dust, fern-fibres, twig-shreds and burrs that accumulated constantly. several cracks made him turn and freeze, sliding his gun into a firing grip between smooth, dry palms. something was moving through the thicket to his left, cracking the occasional spent thorn underfoot. to be fair, they were moving with extreme and trained stealth, but still their progress sounded like a careless march to mkoll's acute hearing. mkoll drew his knife, its long silver blade deliberately dulled with ash. he backed into a thorn stalk and moulded his body to the kinking plant. two steps, one. he swung out, only pulling back his blade at the last moment. trooper dewr cried out and fell backwards, splintering dry stalks as he dropped. mkoll didn't answer. mkoll was scanning around, his gun ready. all the scouts knew mkoll's exacting standards, and knew just as well how they all failed to meet them. dewr felt angry, in fact. during basic training, before that as a hunter in the southern gameland of tanith attica, he'd been reckoned as a good tracker. that was why they had selected him for the scout unit when the regiment mustered, for feth's sake! and this old bastard made him feel like a fool, a clumsy fool! wordlessly, ignoring the stare he knew dewr was boring into the back of his head, mkoll signalled an advance, heading down the slope into the fern-choked vale. the tanith had arrived on ramillies two weeks before, just in time to miss the main action. the adeptus astartes had cleaned out and secured the four enemy strongholds, banishing chaos from the world. the ghosts had assembled on the low plains near one burning fortress, seeing space marines, threatening bulks in the smoky distance like the giants of myth, piling the ragged corpses of slain cultists onto pyres. the air had been thick with filthy char. it seemed some small components of the enemy had fled the defeat, making into the fern forests in the north, too small and insignificant for the glorious space marines to waste time upon. the commissar was charged with a search and destroy detail. the ghosts had advanced into the low hills and the dense forestation, to smoke out the last of the foe. there were a few early successes: enclaves of cultists, some well-armed, dug into bolt-holes and lodges, making a last stand. then, after a week, as they reached the colder, higher plateaux and the real thickness of the fern-cover, a working pattern developed. mkoll would plan recon sweeps each day, deploying a couple of dozen scouts in a wide fan into the thickets. they would quarter each area and report back, signalling in the main ghost forces if contact was made. perhaps they had become lazy, complacent. major rawne averred that they had silenced the last of the enemy and were now wasting their time and patience cutting deeper and deeper into the lonely territories of the hinterland. the commissar himself seemed devoted to discharging the task properly, but even he had doubled the reach and range of the scout sweeps. another few days and they would quit, he had told mkoll. this day, this high cold windy day, with the ever present whisper of the ferns, the scouts had gone deeper and wider into the hills. there had been no contact with anything for two whole sweeps. mkoll sensed that less dedicated troopers like dewr were getting slack with the routine. but he himself had seen things that kept him sharp and made him determined to press on. things he had reported to gaunt to convince him to work the forests a little longer: broken paths in the vegetation; trampled areas; torn, apparently random trails in the underbrush. there was something still out here. they crossed the valley floor and came up the shaded side, where the ferns listed restlessly, like shadow-fans. every dozen or so steps, dewr's feet cracked a thorn or a seed case, or chinked a rock, no matter how delicately he walked. he cursed every sound. he was determined to prove his ability to mkoll. and he had no clue how mkoll moved so silently, like he was floating. the ferns hissed in the wind. mkoll stopped to check his compact chart and referred his eyes to sun and compass. within a quarter of an hour their circuit should bring them into contact with rafel and waed, on a mirror sweep towards them. mkoll suddenly held up a hand and dewr stopped sharp. the scout sergeant fanned his fingers twice to indicate dewr should cover, and the other slid in low beside a thick fern stem, knelt and raised his lasgun. there was dust on the exchanger and he wiped it off. dust in his eyes too, and he wiped them. he braced and then took aim, rolling it left and right as mkoll advanced. mkoll dropped down another few metres and found another torn trail in the fem. as wide as three men walking abreast, ferns uprooted or snapped and trampled. mkoll gingerly touched one sappy, broken twist of stalk. it was as thick as his thigh, and the bark was tough as iron. he could not have severed it this clean even with a wood axe. he checked the ground. trample marks, deep and wide, like giant footsteps. the trail snaked away both ahead and behind as far as he could see, uneven, weaving. mkoll raised three fingers and circled them. dewr advanced to join him. the younger man looked at the trail, questions in his mouth, but the look in mkoll's eyes told him not to ask them. not to say anything. there was no sound at all except the hissing of the fronds. dewr knelt and looked at the trail for himself. something� someone� big, moving blindly. his fingers touched something buried in the ashy soil and he plucked it out. a chunk of blackened metal, part of the rim of something, large as a cupped hand. he held it out to mkoll. the sergeant took it with genuine interest, studied it, and tucked it into his thigh pouch. he nodded a firm acknowledgement to dewr for his sharp eyes. dewr felt greater pride in that fleeting moment than he had ever done in his life before. or would again. they moved on, down the trail line, following the bent-forward fronds which indicated the direction of motion. after sixty metres, the trail veered uphill. mkoll stopped and wiped his weapon again. a scream cut the air, as bright and sharp as a tanith blade. they both started. it shut off abruptly, but while it lasted it had been unmistakably human. mkoll was moving in an instant, following the source of the sound. dewr went after him, trying to keep his hurried steps silent. they moved off the trail into the thickets. ahead, the foliage changed. under the crest of the slope, thicker, spined cacti grew in clusters; fibrous, gourd-like growths lined with long needles were arrayed down each seam of the plant sac.  there were hundreds of the plants, some knee high, some higher and fatter than a man, a forest of needle-studded bulbs. another, weaker scream came, as from a man waking from a nightmare and abruptly dying away as he realised it was but a dream. and another sound, close on the heels of the scream. a hollow, plosive, spitting sound, like someone retching fruit pits from his throat. they found rafel crumpled amid the gourd-bulbs. a trail of blood, bright spatters on the ashy ground, showed where he had dropped and how he had crawled. over a dozen needles, some more than a foot long, impaled him. one went through his eye into his brain. dewr, in horror, was about to speak, but mkoll whirled and clamped his hand over the younger man's mouth. mkoll pointed to the nearest of the large cactus growths, indicating where a line of spines were absent, leaving only a line of sap-drooling orifices. the voice crackled out of the corpse's intercom. mkoll drove himself into dewr, knocking him aside, away from rafel as the three bulbs nearest the body shuddered and spat spines. a salvo of those hollow spitting coughs again. needles stabbed into rafel's corpse like arrows and bounced off the ground around them. one went through dewr's shin. he wanted to scream but managed to master it. the pain was sharp, then dull. his leg went cold. mkoll rolled off him. dewr pointed feebly at his leg, but the sergeant seemed to ignore it. he made a quick adjustment to the intercom at his collar and then reached down to dewr's, switching it off. only then did he turn to the wound. he took out his knife and cut the cloth away from dewr's shin, slicing the straps holding the chain-cloth bandages in place. the needle had passed right through the chain, directly through the eye of some links and severing others. mkoll turned the knife round and forced the hilt into dewr's mouth. instinctively, dewr bit down and mkoll yanked the needle free. there was very little blood. that was bad. the blood was clotting and turning yellow fast and the sticky residue on the spine suggested venom. but the needle had only punctured flesh, which was good. the force of it could have shattered the shin bone. dewr bit hard on the hilt a while longer. as the pain ebbed, he slackened his mouth and the knife slid out down his cheek onto the ground. mkoll rose. he would get rafel's field dressings and bind the wound. rafel wouldn't need them now. he turned. his foot cracked a thorn on the ground. a moment of carelessness, triggered by his concern for dewr. a bulb shuddered at the crack and spat a needle. it passed through the stock of mkoll's lasgun and the point stopped an inch from his belly. he unfroze and breathed, then pulled it out. mkoll crossed to rafel and freed his field dressing pouch, pinned to his waist by another needle through the strap. he returned to dewr and bound the wound. dewr's head began to spin. it was an easy, fluid feeling, like his cares were ebbing away. there was a gnawing feeling in his leg and hip, but it was somehow pleasant. mkoll saw the vacant glaze coming over dewr's eyes. unceremoniously, he took another length of gauze dressing and jammed it into dewr's mouth, taping the gag tightly in place. a delirious man may not realise the sound he is making. he was about to lift dewr onto his shoulder when another sound came. a ripping and crashing, distant at first, accompanied by the relentless retching spit of the bulbs as the tearing sound set them off. something was coming, something drawn by rafel's last scream. something gigantic. as it burst into the clearing, all of the cacti around them spontaneously shed their needles in a blitz of venomous barbs. the fusillade rattled off the metal carapace and legs. mkoll threw himself over dewr and they lay there, silent and still under the storm of darts. the chaos dreadnought came to a halt on its great hydraulic feet, sighing and hissing. there was a stench of heat and a throb of electromagnetic power that prickled the hairs on mkoll's neck. it was four metres tall, wider than three men, blackened and scorched as if it had walked through hell and back. all signs of paint or insignia had been burnt off, to bare metal in some places. a malign presence oozed from it, filling the atmosphere. such a great machine was terrifying enough in itself, but the malevolent feeling of it � mkoll felt his gorge rise and clamped his jaws. dewr seemed unconscious. the dreadnought took a step forward, almost tentative and dainty though the great steel hoof shook the earth as it fell and triggered another volley of spines. its body rotated as if scanning, and it took another step. another plankplank of rebounding spines. it was blind. mkoll could see that at a glance. the wounds of the adeptus astartes were deep and fearful across its visor. its optical units had been blown away in some great act. mkoll knew the semi-circle of burnt metal dewr had found was from the recess socket of one of its eyes. it had been blundering around the fern forests for days, hunting by sound alone. another step. another hiss of pistons and a growl of motivator. another thump of footfall, and other rain of darts. it was only three metres from them now, still cranking its body around, listening. dewr started and woke up. he saw the dreadnought � and his filmy, poisoned eyes made even greater nightmares out of the existing one. he convulsed and screamed. despite the gauze gag, the scream was fierce and high pitched, strangulated and horrible through the choke. mkoll knew he had an instant to react, even as dewr stirred. he dived aside. the dreadnought swung and targeted the source of the scream as rapidly as the plants around them did. poison needles spat into a body that had, mere microseconds before, been incinerated by a belching plasma gun. needles rattled off the dreadnought again. mkoll moved low, sliding round the bulk of the bulbs, trying to keep the listening death machine in sight. his heart was thumping. he cursed it for being so loud. behind the next break of growth, he slid in low and checked his weapon. there were fern fronds caught in the trigger. he thought at once to pull them free and then stopped. it would make a sound, and what was the use? what good would a lasgun be against that? he moved again, his foot skittering a stone. needles spat ineffectually. the dreadnought began to move, following the sound, walking through rains of needles that convulsed and flew at each footfall. mkoll thought to run. it was blind, the plants were blind. if he could only stay silent � and that was his gift � he could slip away and take the information to gaunt. but would they find it again? out here, in such a wilderness? it could take weeks to relocate the dreadnought, the lives of many to neutralise it. if he could only� no. madness. suicide. then he heard the voice. distant. it was waed, calling for rafel. he was beyond the needle bulbs, searching, querying why rafel had stopped transmitting. in moments, surely, he would be triggering needles. or summoning the dreadnought. already, the blind beast had turned and begun to stride through the thicket, crushing the spitting cactus to ochre mash. mkoll had seconds to think. he would not lose another of his scout cadre, not like this. he took out a grenade, primed it and threw it left.  the crump took out a cluster of bulbs in a spray of fire and matted fibres, and caused a flurry of spines to shoot. mkoll then headed directly for the blast site. he slid in with his back to one of the bulbs that had triggered at the sound of the explosion. its needle apertures were spent. he could use it as cover safely now it was unarmed. the dreadnought was thumping his way, drawn by the sound of the grenade. waed had fallen silent. mkoll adjusted his gun and set it on the ground. mkoll turned and faced waed with a look that brooked no denial. but you killed it� the co-pilot yelped, frantically making adjustments. corbec to squad. voices chatted back along the link, responding. by corbec's side, trooper larkin was cradling his lasgun and looking up at the sky with trembling fear. psyker madness, very bad. haven't you never heard of morale? corbec grimaced. corbec shivered. he didn't feel lucky. brin milo woke up. he was upside down, blind, suspended painfully from his restraint rig, his ribs bruised blue and a taste of blood in his mouth. but � unless someone was about to play a really nasty trick on him � he was alive. he could hear� very little. the trickle and patter of falling water. a creaking. someone moaning softly. there was a loud bang and light flared into his dark-accustomed eyes. he smelled thermite and realised someone had just ejected the emergency hull-plates using the explosive bolts. daylight � thin, green, wet daylight � streamed in. bragg's huge face swam up in front of milo's, upside down. milo shook his head. he asked. the troop-ship, now just a crumpled sleeve of metal, had impacted at a steep angle on its roof. milo climbed down and gazed back up at the mangled wreck. what amazed him only slightly less than the fact he was still alive, was that they had come down in what appeared to be a jungle. enormous pinkish trees that looked like swollen, magnified root vegetables, formed a dense forest of flaccid trunks around them. the huge growths were strung with thick ropey vines, creepers and flowering tendrils, and thorny fern and horsetail covered the moist, steaming ground. everything was green, as all light � except for a single clear shaft which slanted down through the trees where the troop-ship had burst through � was filtered by the dense canopy of foliage above their heads. it was humid, and sticky, and sappy water dripped from the trees. there was a sweet stink of fungoid flowers. bragg clambered down from the wreck, and joined the boy. a dozen other ghosts had clambered out and were sat down or leaning against trees, waiting for spinning heads and ringing ears to clear. all had minor cuts and scrapes, except trooper obel who lay on a makeshift stretcher, his chest bloody and torn. corporal meryn had taken charge. he and caffran were trying to open other emergency hatches to look for more survivors. milo saw rawne had survived. the major stood to one side with a tall, pale ghost called i'eygor, who served as his aide. milo found rawne by his side. gaunt appeared, sliding down from a side vent in the punctured hull. he was tattered and bruised, with blood soaking the shoulder and side of his tunic under his coat. meryn hurried over to him to assist. rawne looked up at the wreck. gaunt growled. gaunt grinned, but without humour. in fifteen minutes, the survivors were assembled and injuries tended. salvageable equipment and weapons were divided up. both milo and the dazed co-pilot were given a laspistol and a few spare power cells. obel and the nowfreed brennan lay unconscious on stretcher pallets. rawne looked grimly at gaunt. he nodded his head at the two injured men. gaunt frowned. meryn and feygor raised the two stretcher cases onto an a-frame of wood and bragg took the weight of the point on his shoulder. caffran had used his silver tanith knife to cut lengths of waxy creeper and bound them on for a grip.  but with the party clearing the way, he could pull them along on the slingbed efficiently enough. marauder flights are all out of action, sir. fleet command recalled them because of the storm. corbec glanced up at the corrosive purple turbulence that passed for sky. forget the aircraft, that nightmare was screwing with his guidance. this close to a manifestation of chaos, his senses were whirling. his balance was shot and he felt nauseous, with a throbbing pain in his temple. terror dimpled his skin and ached in his marrow. he dared not think about what was out there, waiting for him. and he knew his men were the same. there had been a dozen spontaneous nosebleeds already, and several men had convulsed, vomiting. still, they were making headway, clawing through the grim habitat towers and the workforce residence blocks where things came down to knife and pistol, room to room, in the old, dirty tenements where the lowest level of worker had dwelt. the commissar would have been proud, corbec thought. the ghosts had done the job. he spat out a fly and listened carefully to the flow of radio traffic again for a moment. the fleet command channel repeated its overriding directive: unless the enemy psykers could be neutralised, the fleet couldn't land any more reinforcements, any more of the five million imperial guard troops still waiting in troop-ships in orbit. or deploy air-cover. the fate of the entire battle teetered in the balance. corbec brushed off another fly. the air was thick with them now, choked with flies and cinders and ash. the smell was unbearable. colm corbec took a deep, shuddering breath. he knew the signs: they were close to something, something bad. something of chaos. he gestured up the stairwell. daemon! gaunt held up a hand and announced a ten minute rest. the group eased back and took the weight off their feet, leaning on tree trunks, hunkering down. milo heard him say. milo crossed over as gaunt himself approached. meryn looked up, treating the ugly wounds of the two unconscious men. their wounds gel re-infected as fast as i clean them. obel's fading fast. some kind of fungus necrotizing the raw flesh. maggots too. rawne? answer! gaunt hissed. the ghosts moved forward and milo moved with them, checking his pistol was cleared to fire. despite the fear, he felt pride. the commissar had needed all the men he could muster. he had not thought twice about including milo. corbec was sure: his life was over when larkin started shooting. driven over the edge by what he had seen nailed along the wall, larkin just went crazy; mindless, oblivious to the otherwise transfixing image of chaos in that old tenement. corbec hissed. the little man's howl was drying away into a hoarse whisper. a repetitive clicking came from the lasgun in his hands, the power cell exhausted. the lashing tentacles of the vast thing in the hallway had been driven back by the hammerblow of relentless laser fire. they had a moment of grace, time to retreat. he yelled to raglon over his bead. spat rawne, dropped down against a tree nearby as metal shot exploded the bark behind him. he threw down gaunt's chainsword and swung his own lasgun up to fire. feygor took up a prone position, blasting with his own weapon, kalen to his side. the four ghost lasguns blasted an arc of fire into the dense trees, the dim grove flickering with the muzzle flashes. hissed gaunt. called gaunt, and took the instrument as milo offered it up. an imperial installation. three armoured, modular cabins, two larger hardened shelters� they've all had the insignia spraypainted out. communicator-array and up-link mast for a voxcaster , that's probably what's jamming us� perimeter defence net� slaved servitors mounted into autoloader bolt cannons. you must have tripped a sensor as you came in, major. triggered them off. caffran murmured. good question. don't you see? it's causing the storm. varl sneered. corbec wasn't so sure. corbec said, exasperated. he thought hard. there had to be something � something� what would gaunt have done? something arrogant, no doubt. executive officer kreff cleared his throat, took a deep breath and stepped into the strategium, the captain's armoured inner sanctum at the centre of the navarre's bridge. captain wysmark sat in dark, contemplative silence on a reclined throne, quietly assessing the flickering overlays of runic and schematic data that flowed across the smoothly curved walls and roof of the room. wysmark grinned back, very slightly. he rotated his chair to face kreff. kreff jumped forward and handed him the data-slate. wysmark keyed his micro-bead intercom. all so very neat and civil, kreff smiled. this really was the only way to fight a war. there was a blink of light, an astonishing shockwave that knocked them all down, and then a deafening roar that hammered across them. they scrambled up to the top of the slope and looked over the balustrade. below them, the ruinous expanse of a ten-lane highway stretched into the dark industrial high rises of the hive. varl stammered. he glanced down the slope at the hundreds of waiting troops below, troops who could already sense the change in the air. there was smoke, and fumes and cordite � but the stink of chaos was retreating. the storm was blowing itself out. he yelled into his bead. or at least, gaunt thought, i hope he didn't. if this had been done with foreknowledge, deliberately� he shook the idea away. i scouted around the perimeter. gaunt smiled. mused corbec, sat on his bunk in the troop bay. bragg shook his head and swigged from the bottle of sacra. oh, him. a forward post, looking out into the water-choked thickness of the monthax jungles. the flies were thick out here, like sparkling dust in the air. amphibians gurgled and chugged in the mudbanks. the sappers had raised the spit-post out beyond the broad levees of the main embankment, one of six that allowed the tanith snipers greater reach into the front line. they were long, zagged and lined with frag-sacking and a double layer of overlapped flak-boards. gaunt edged along the spit, keeping low, passing the sentries at the heavy-bolter post at the halfway point. the mud, unmoving and stagnant in the dug-away bed, stank like liquescent death. the sagging cable of a land-line voxcaster ran down the length of the sacking, held above the water by iron loop-pins. gaunt knew it ended at a voxset at the sniper post. in the event of attack, he would want the earliest warning from his keen-eyed forwards, and one that could be conveyed by good old, reliable, un-scrambleable cable. larkin was his usual edgy self.  at the loop hole at the end of the spit-post, he was sat on a nest of sacking, meticulously polishing his weapon. a compulsive, gaunt thought. the commissar stepped up to him. larkin looked around, tense. but for how much longer, he wondered? five the angel of bucephalon larkin thought about death. he thought he might well have begged for it long ago, had he not been so scared of it. he had never figured out, though he had spent whole nights wondering it, whether he was more afraid of death itself or the fear of death. worse, there had been so many times when he had expected to find out. so many moments caught in death's frosty gaze, snapped at by death's steel incisors. the question had been nearly answered so many times. now perhaps, he would find out. here. death, or the fear of death. if the angel knew, she was saying nothing. her stern face was turned down, demure, eyes closed as if sleeping, praying hands clasped at her breast. outside, below them, the war to take bucephalon raged. the stained glass in the huge lancet window, what remained of it, shook and twinkled with reflections of tracer sprays, salvos of blazing rockets, bright air-bursts. larkin sat back against the cold stone pillar and rubbed a dirty hand around his lean jaw. his breathing was slowing now at last, his pulse dropping, the anxiety attack that had seen him wailing and gasping five minutes ago was passing like a cyclone. or maybe he was just in the eye of that storm. the ground shook. he felt it through the pillar. his pulse leapt for a moment. he forced himself to breathe deeply through his mouth, slow, deep inhalations of the sort he used to steady himself before taking a shot. larkin looked round at the angel. though her head was still angled down, now she was gazing at him, smiling grimly. but it's just another trigger. she laughed and smoothed the folds of the white robes over her kneeling legs. there was a low and perfect radiance to her. larkin blinked and saw glowing moons and oblongs in afterimage again. outside, a hail of gunfire lit the evening and a ripple of explosions crackled the air. larkin got to his feet and crossed to the nearest window. he looked out through interlocking pieces of coloured glass at the city below. steepled, tall, rising within a curtain of walls eighty metres high, the capital city-state of bucephalon clung to the ridge of the mountains. smoke obscured the sky, las-fire filled the air like bright sleet. two or more kilometres away, he saw the pair of enormous storming ramps that the sappers of the imperial guard had raised against the walls. huge embankments of piled earth and concrete rubble almost a kilometre long, rising high and broad enough to deliver armoured vehicles to the top of the wall. heavy fighting within blooms of flame lit the ramps. below, nearer, the men on the ground looked like insect dots. thousands, churning in trenches, spilling out across the chewed and cratered mess of the battlefront to assault the forbidding walls. larkin's vantage point was high and good. this shelled, ruined fortress was part of a stone complex which straddled and guarded the main aqueduct into the city, a huge structure that had defied the most earnest attempts of the enemy to fell with mines. though heavily defended, it had seemed to commissar gaunt a good way in for a stealth team. not the first time the commissar had been wrong. gaunt had told them that, before the clutch of chaos fell upon it, the city-state had been ruled by thirty-two noble families, the descendants of merchant dynasties that had established the settlement. their brilliant banners, the heraldic displays of thirty-two royal houses, were displayed on the walls, tatters of rich cloth draped from massive timber awnings. those mighty awnings were now additionally decorated with the crucified bodies of the leaders of those noble families. it had been nokad's first act. nokad the blighted, nokad the smiling, the charismatic cult leader whose malign forces had risen to conquer bucephalon from within, and win one of the most honourable of the sabbat worlds. in his great liberation address at the start of the crusade, warmaster slaydo himself had listed proud bucephalon as one of the worlds he was most eager to save. shells burst outside the windows and larkin ducked back into cover. glass pattered and tinkled onto the stone floor. the flashes behind his eyes were getting worse and he could taste the tang of metal in his saliva. there was a moaning, too, a dull aching groan in his inner ear. that was a particularly bad sign. he had only got that a time or two before, just prior to the very worst madnesses. his vision was not entirely stable. everything in the chapel around him seemed elongated and stretched, like in the mirror tent at the attica carnival. in places his vision belled and warped, objects shimmering in and out of focus, drifting near and then away again. he shuddered, deep in his bones. the angel was lighting tapers at the wrought iron offertory. her movements were slow and lovely, pure grace. he bumped against a pillar across the debris-littered aisle and turned back to her with ferocious eyes. his vision was pulsing now, lights and alterations dancing and flexing across his line of sight. she seemed far away, then huge and upon him. he could see the way her silver-gold tresses fell to waist length between the powerful furled wings which emerged from slits in her samite gown. her head was bowed. larkin screamed and pressed his face into the stone floor. his wiry body began to twitch as the storm of madness, the tidal wave of anxiety, rose and crested in his thundering mind. he felt he was in a vacuum now. there was no sound, no vision, no pain. just her voice. larkin looked up sharply. the angel stood by the reliquary, lifting the studded wooden lid. she took something out and placed it upon her head, smoothing her silver-gold hair under the brim. it was a cap. a commissar's regimental cap. gaunt's cap. she reached into the holy box and lifted out something else, wrapped in dusty, mouldering cloth. her perfect hands unwound it. a bolt pistol. with incongruous sureness, her slender hands slammed a sicklepattern magazine into the slot, racked the slide and thumbed off the safety. she turned. her face, below the commissar's cap, was lean and angular. larkin hadn't realised how chiselled and thin her cheeks and chin were before. cut out of stone, firm and fierce, like ibram gaunt. she raised the bolt pistol in her right hand and pointed it at larkin. her wings opened and spread, twenty metres wide, a vast arch of perfect white eagle feathers. and i have much in common. a common purpose, a common function. inspiration and punishment. did you desert, larkin? every joint in his body ached, every nerve sang. his head was clear and yet racing and strange. he laughed. larkin slid his sniper rifle from the sling across the back of his pack. he held up a bulky tube to show her for a moment, then slotted it into a bracket on the side of the gun case. think what you like. i'll tell you what i know. nokad will want to defend it just as hard. and that means inspiring his troops along the length of it. then i'm just another nameless wooden marker in the cemetery. a long pause. more than that, your weapon must be pointing naturally at the target. nokad grinned as he passed the corpses. imperial guard, weak, puny things, draped in dull fatigues and anonymous cloaks. there was fighting ahead, the barking returns of lasguns at close range. corbec was in the canal gully with three remaining men and rawne yelling through the intercom. nokad advanced. his men loved him. they sang together, jubilant as they forced the invaders back. on the canal lip, nokad howled his inspirational verses to his men, arms uplifted, chainsword whirring. there was a crack, a stab of light � and nokad's head vanished in a film of blood. corbec pulled him upright, unsteady on his legs. larkin's lasgun lay on the floor, its barrel broken, burnt and spent. and i thought you'd run on us! honestly! larkin said, looking up. corbec pointed to the damaged statue of the angel above the chapel font, a beautiful winged woman knelt in the attitude of prayer. her perfect hands were clasped. her head was bowed demurely. the inscription on the plinth rejoiced that she was a symbol of the god-emperor, a personification of the golden throne who had come to the elders of bucephalon in the first days of the colony and watched over them as they conquered the land. an old myth. corbec laughed. larkin began to laugh too. he convulsed and gagged with the force of laughter inside him. corbec dragged him from the chapel, both laughing still. the very last thing larkin saw before corbec wrenched him away was his fallen lasgun, with the peerless, scorched white cloth still wrapped around the barrel. a sudden barrage of enemy guns, distant, impatient, came on just before the middle of the night over monthax, and stippled the belly of the low brown sky with reflected flashes of fire and light. wet, hollow rumbles barked and growled through the swamps and ground mist like starving hounds. leagues away, some brutal night-combat was underway. gaunt woke instinctively at the sound of the guns and took a walk out of the command shed. the sound was coming from the east and he had a sergeant circle around to check on the sentry lines. the artillery sounded like someone flapping and cracking a large, sweat-damp sheet in the hot, heavy air. he crossed a gurgling creek via a duck-board bridge and made it into the tree line just as the humidity broke and cold drooling rain began to fall through air suddenly stirred by chill breezes. it was almost a relief, but the rain was sticky and sappy and stung his eyes. gaunt found himself on the embanked approach to one of the main sentry towers and pulled himself up the ladder. the towers, set at hundred metre intervals along the main defile, rose some ten metres out of the surface filth. they were fashioned from groups of tree-trunks, shored together and stout buttressed with riveted beams, and supported large flak-board gun-nests mounted on the top. up in the dark nest, trooper bragg tended a cradle-mounted pair of twinned heavy bolters, drums of shells piled around his huge feet. bragg saluted, his big face cracking into a broad, embarrassed grin. he was making fortified caffeine over a little burner, his huge paws dwarfing the pot and cup. he tried to hide the flask of sacra behind the stove, but the scent of the liquor was pungent in the close air of the nest. gaunt nodded the salute. bragg seemed to relax. he sloshed a generous measure of sacra into a second battered cup and fussed over the boiling pot. gaunt was amused, as always, by the combination of brutal strength and timidity in this giant of a man. bragg's hands were big and strong enough to crush skulls, but he moved almost meekly, as if afraid of his own strength � or afraid of what others might think him capable of. he handed the commissar a hot cup and gaunt sat on a pile of shell-drums, gesturing out across the jungle to the east. the nest's raised vantage point afforded a better view of the distant fighting. flares and tracers showed above the trees, and as the rain dissipated the mist, there were ruddy ground fires to be seen amid the trunks. bragg nodded, sipping his own cup. bragg patted his heavy weapons. gaunt grinned. bragg was a good heavy weapons technician, but his aim had scarcely improved since the founding. i told major rawne that you'd help the detail re-dig tomorrow. they need some heavy lifting. bragg was a strange man. gaunt had decided that long ago. he'd never met a human so physically powerful, yet mentally restrained, as if he was somehow afraid of the terrible power he could unleash. others took it for stupidity and regarded big old bragg as dumb. but the man patently wasn't stupid. in his own, quiet, mountainous way, he was the most formidable and dangerous ghost of all. so preoccupied by his physical power, others always underestimated the mind behind it. and the mind, gaunt knew, was the strongest thing of all. six that hideous strength caligula, after the imperial liberation. nights as bright as day, lit by the burning hive cities; days as dark as night, choked by the petrochemical smoke. soot, like fat, black snowflakes, fluttered down everywhere. even out here, in the deadlands. steepled canyons of coral-bright rock. wisps of fluorescent dust licking the high places and the rims of the calderas. cracked, dry basins of hard, russet cake-earth. wide, slumping ridges of glass-sand. and death, bleached and baked white, like bones that had been out in the sun for years. eighteen cargo transports, thirty-wheel monsters, coughing blue exhaust from their vertical pipe-stacks, ground down the red-rock pass in low gear. the tractor units at the front of each payload wagon were monsters, armoured cabs of scorched metal rattling on top of a huge engine unit, glaring forward through multiple fog-lamp eyes and grinning fly-flecked smiles of fender bars, radiator grilles and spiked running boards, flanking the massive transports were the outriders, rushing through the dust on track-bikes and in armoured cars. palapr tuvant, transport driver, caligula born and bred, wrestled with the half-moon wheel of the convoy's lead freighter and glanced around at his co-driver.  hewn milloom was looking out of the cab window, occasionally regarding his chronometer. they were both wringing with sweat, entombed by the heat from the roaring engine under their feet. milloom had dropped the window armour panels and opened the metal vents in the hope of washing them with cool breeze from outside. but the surface temperature out in the deadlands was pushing forty degrees, and they baked. occasionally, sprays of hot engine oil spurted back from the leaky head gasket and spattered in at them through the forward grillescreen. milloom sat back in his ripped leather seat and looked up at the cab's ceiling hatch. tuvant nodded, wrenching the wheel. that'll be good. when the colonel-commissar ordered me to command this convoy detail, i said to him i will get it through on time, trust me, colonel-commissar. i will. milloom muttered something unflattering about the high and mighty colonel-commissar. milloom turned slowly to face the huge tanith. milloom sat back and exchanged knowing grins with the driver. the giant replied brightly. the convoy rolled on into the deadlands. it had assembled that morning on a stained curtain road outside the halfburned ruin of the aurelian hive city, where a second front of imperial guard had seized control after the main assault on nero hive. the mammoth imperium victory was in no doubt, but still pockets of enemy soldiers held out, fighting a lingering war of wastage and attrition to wear out the lines of supply. the imperial guard closed in en masse to root out and eradicate all remnants of resistance, and the work to rebuild caligula began. what resources were available � and despite everything aurelian hive was rich in storehouses � had to be redistributed. the convoy marked the first attempt to convey relief supplies to the stricken hive calphernia. six convoys had departed aurelian hive that dawn. four were headed to nero hive, one to tiberius and one to calphernia. gaunt's ghosts, the tanith first, were given the protection duty. it was agreed that the run to calphernia was the most dangerous, as it crossed the territories of bandits � ex-hive workers who had fled the war and set themselves up as feudal warlords in the waste. not a single relief vehicle had made it through in the last six weeks and the rumours told of thousands of rebels, stockpiling weapons. some even whispered that chaos powers were involved. everyone, including bragg himself, was amazed when gaunt chose bragg to command the defence of the calphernia convoy. gaunt had ignored all the protests and taken the bemused bragg into his command bunker to brief him. caober, rawne, larkin and the other ghosts decided that gaunt's choice simply represented an acceptance that the calphernia convoy wouldn't get through. rawne had hissed, playing with the hilt of his silver tanith dagger. others fidgetted nervously, unhappy with what seemed to be going on but unwilling to question gaunt's authority directly. bragg simply grinned at the honour bestowed upon him. it seemed he missed the irony. he was oblivious to the fact that he was already given up as dead. rawne spat in the dust. caffran felt a pulse in his temple that wasn't simply the heat. he'd seen the expression on colonel corbec's face when gaunt had given the convoy command to bragg.  they were dead out here, as good as written off. the hundred burnt and crucified bodies they had passed on the roadside an hour before had nothing to do with imagination. caffran shuddered. other outriders whirred forward in hazes of dust. trooper kelve drove one cycle with merrt, one of corbec's favoured sharpshooters, in the rear cradle. merrt had his sniper gun wrapped in oil-cloth in the footwell below him, ready to switch to it when the autocannon rig ran dry. kelve pulled them up to a revving halt on a sand-rise. to their left, engine idling, was ochrin and his gunner hellat. to their right, five hundred metres distant, mkendrick and his gunner beris. a signal, waved from bike to bike, then they all flew forward into the dusty basin beyond, racing parallel to the track left by meryn and caffran. the huge convoy thundered in after them. tailing it, and flanking the rear, came three more outriders: fulke with logris gunning, mktea with laymon at the weapons, and tanhak with grummed manning the cannons. behind them, an imperial guard half-track driven by wheln, with abat and brostin at the weapons stations, and another with long, double-tracks driven by mkteeg with rahan and nehn crewing a missile launcher platform. bragg clambered up into the gun-turret over the cab of his tractor, half-hearing the whispered slanging of the caligulan drivers, milloom and tuvant. heat and dust assaulted his big face. the sun was a torrential heat. his nostrils immediately clogged with ash-dust and he had to hawk and spit to clear his head. as an afterthought, he wrapped his stealth cloak around his mouth and nose, pulling out the goggles he had been issued and also remembering to wipe zinc paste over his exposed skin. the paste, clagging and damp in a small circular tin, smelled bad, but the colonel-commissar had told them all to use it. sliding his bike to a halt, ochrin pulled out his tin and grudgingly applied paste to his brow and nose. he held the tin out, straight armed, to hellat in the back. there was soft, distant ping, a hollow, empty sound. hellat took the tin from ochrin's outstretched hand just as he realised ochrin no longer had a face. ochrin's corpse flopped stiffly back off the saddle. bragg shambled across to the caligulan drivers. there was a dull look in his eye tuvant didn't like. with one meaty, hairy-knuckled paw, bragg lifted tuvant off the cabin deck by his throat. the colonelcommissar said so.  if we have to fight our way through to calphernia a micron at a time, we will. and we will all fight. bragg dropped tuvant, who sprawled, retching, and turned to face the other driver. milloom had his greasy axle-bar in his hands. milloom launched forward to crush the big man's skull with five kilos of cold-stamped metal. bragg broke stride lightly, impossibly lightly it seemed for such a great bulk. he caught the descending bar in one palm. there was an audible slap. milloom gasped as the bar was pulled out of his hands. bragg tossed it aside. you can help even if you don't know the business end of a weapon from your own arse. get on the voxcaster. recite the ecclesiarchy's oath of obedience. make it clear and proud. recite it again, then again and then again. if you get bored, insert the emperor's daily prayer for variation. maybe the imperial litany of deliverance for good measure. fill the voxchannels with soothing, inspiring words. milloom started to speak into the caster horn, remembering the verses he had learned as a child. outside, laser and stub fire whined into the circled convoy. the outriders were laying in hard. meryn drew his bike in so that caffran could do real damage to the slowly encircling bandits. fulke, mktea and tanhak ran the line. from the back of fulke's machine, logris excelled and scored four kills. mktea's gunner laymon made one of his own before the upper part of his head was scythed off by a las shot at the mouth. tanhak and grummed made six, maybe seven, good kills before a short-range missile ended their lives and their glory. wheln yelled from the half-track, abat dead behind him and brostin blazing with his flamer. in the cab of his freighter, bragg was calmly unwrapping his autocannons from a felt shroud. behind him, milloom was steadily reciting into the vox-horn. not one but two autocannons, the like of which were usually fixed to tripod or pintle mounts. bragg had them lashed together, with a makeshift trigger array made out of a bent ration-pack fork so he could fire them as a pair. long belt loops of ammunition played out from the gun-slots, leading back to a parcel of round-boxes. bragg punched out the perspex window section from the rear of the cab and laid his twin muzzles across the sill. he looked back at tuvant. tuvant blinked. then he scrambled forward and grabbed the ammo-belts, easing them around so they would pull unobstructed from the boxes. he squeezed the trigger assembly. the twin guns barked deafeningly in the confines of the cab. milloom paused in his recitation, and covered his ears with a grimace. tuvant shuddered, but kept working dutifully to play the ammo-belts out clear and clean. shell cases billowed through the air like chaff. bragg's first devastating salvo had gone wide, passing over the top of the nearby cliffs. he grinned at himself and adjusted his aim. nothing. merit's scope wasn't lying now. he could see over three dozen bandits advancing over the dunes under cover of the foggy dust kicked up by the firefight. they were running low, heads down, hugging the contours of the ground. merrt took aim at the nearest one. he sighed and fired, timing his finger to the moment of respiratory emptiness so nothing in his torso would jerk the aim. the laser burst punched through the top of the bandit's bowl-helmet, presented as it was by his head-down approach. the shot probably passed down through his skull, his neck and his torso, following the line of his spinal column, merrt thought, as the figure dropped stone dead in a crumpled pile. he adjusted his aim and took another bandit in the face when he looked up to take a bearing. a slight swing to the left, and another came into his sight, scurrying forward to gain new cover. a sigh. a squeeze. a slight recoil. the figure flipped back and fell still. merit readjusted and was about to target a small group of infantry when their position dissolved in a haze of heat and outflung debris. missile hit, he thought. rahan and nehn were keeping the aim of the missile turret low, sliding off single shots that hugged the ground cover and buried themselves in the foe. mkteeg edged the half-track along the lip of the folded dunes, skirting the enemy as best he could. his weapon crew had almost expended their missiles, so he set the drive in idle and clambered back into the turret bed to set up the stub-gun folded away in a deck-locker.  he had it up and lashed in to the armoured side panel of the track as rahan volleyed off five missiles high into the air. they looked like burning javelins as they arched over the desert and flew down onto unseen targets below the dune. mktea fired the autocannon mount laymon had been manning until the feeder belt jammed and the gun glowed red. with a curse, he snatched up his lasrifle and dived over the side. enemy las-fire reached his vehicle a moment later and blew it up in a shower of metal debris that pattered around him as he crawled through the sand. mktea felt a sharp and painful impact in his ankle. looking back, prone on his belly, he realised his combat trousers were smouldering from the wash of cinders and a thick piece of metal debris had pierced his foot. he beat down the fire then rolled over to yank the debris from his ankle. it was the shattered handle of his vehicle's auto-gun return, he realised. the pain was immense. he pulled at it and passed out momentarily. coming to, he realised that the shrapnel wasn't going to come free from the bones of his foot without a surgeon. he chewed down a handful of painkillers, and as the heady high smacked into his brain, he rolled over and began firing his lasgun into the dune crest behind him. wheln blasted away from his vehicle's turret next to brostin, who had ditched his flamer for a lasrifle. bandits were running at them from a scoop of low-lying desert, and they shot everything that moved. mkendrik realised his guns were out as the last of the belt-feed whickered through the slot and the weapons coughed dry. bandit troops were all over him, charging up to take his machine. he pulled out his laspistol and shot the first one through the head, gutting the second and blowing a knee off the third. then he took a glancing wound in the left shoulder that turned him sideways and knocked him to the deck. there was a roaring sound. meryn's bike came over the rise in a puff of dust, landing hard, caffran hammering the enemy with his guns. meryn slewed to the left as caffran played the cannons around, exploding most of the enemy who were in eye-shot. meryn shouted over the roar of his engine and mkendrik leapt onto the flat-bed next to caffran. meryn gunned the engine and they hammered straight at the enemy lines. tiring from the back of his vehicle, logris, one of mkoll's elite scout brigade, realised his driver was losing it. fulke was crying out, screaming, resisting the hammer of weaponsfire. he slewed the bike around, away from the action. logris bellowed fulke said something absurd and gunned the motor of the outrider towards the comparative safety of the convoy circle. logris climbed forward over the ammo boxes and feeder-cables strewn across the back-platform of the bike. he came upon the whimpering fulke from behind and slammed his head sideways into the armour panel of the pilot's door. the bike shuddered to a sidelong halt as fulke went limp. enemy troops were scurrying across the cracked dust-land towards him. bragg pulled back from the window and released his finger on the trigger assembly. what? tire-patterns! tire-patterns! they're concentrating their fire on the tractor units. it's the freight they want! tuvant and milloom hurried back through the communicating door into the freight section. bragg wiped his brow. his hand was rich with sweat and soot. over the vox-link, he ordered all his crews to do the same. the bandits want this cargo� and so, throne help me, they'll be less sure of shooting at us when we're part of it. he yanked his autocannons off the sill and dragged them and the ammo boxes out onto the top of the freight unit. spat tuvant. bragg sighed and closed his eyes. the maurader bombers came low over the ridge, annihilating the enemy with their belly-slung payloads. tuvant looked at the huge ghost in disbelief. tuvant sagged down onto the freighter-top walkway. bragg hunkered next to him. around them, sheets of incendiary bombs and phosphor fire scorched the hills. tuvant blinked at him, uncertain. bragg patted his vast chest with huge hands. friend of mine, trooper raglon� comms-officer raglon, was monitoring your cipher traffic. i've got you here, tipping off your bandit friends as to the time, schedule, makeup and strength of this convoy. tuvant stammered. a compact auto-pistol was suddenly in milloom's hand as he leapt up. bragg was up in an instant, shielding tuvant and swinging a massive fist at milloom. the gun went off. there was a sickening gristle-crack of impact. the shot went wild. his face mashed beyond recognition, hewn milloom tumbled off the walkway of the freight unit and was dead before his body snapped on the hard-packed desert twenty metres below. bragg turned back to tuvant and helped him up. there was blood on his bulky knuckles. behind them, the sky was washed with heat-wash and cinder-smog from the bombing runs. now, i believe we have a date with calphernia hive. ibram gaunt entered the cave and holstered his bolt-pistol. it seemed that the commissar had fared no better than him. the ork warband had decided to take advantage of the chaos of the crusade's push to seize typhon as part of its attempt to build a raiding foothold into the sabbat worlds. charged with destroying the menace, the ghosts had deployed into the long gorges and ice-floes of the moon and come undone. as rawne's platoon had been cut down along the eastern edge of the screaming valley, so gaunt's had to the west. in retreat, the greenskins had proved the more determined adversaries. the commissar and the major crouched down in the ice cave together. rawne had made no sign of gratitude. rawne spat. bite the hilt. good. maybe not. if you can still spit at me and hold me in contempt, we're not equal. i can lower myself down towards your level to help you� feth, save you. rawne asked. gaunt laughed. he dropped some dehydrated food cubes into the bubbling pan and stirred them. dry-powdered bean soup puffed and formed. he was still laughing as he poured the soup into two tin cups. the wind rose as night fell. it howled outside the mouth of the cave, raising the volume and intensity of the screaming they sat together in the dark, watching the fire. there were only four fuel-blocks left to feed the blaze and gaunt was being careful. he spat at gaunt again instead. gaunt smiled and nodded down at the spittle freezing on the ice. why? gaunt nodded. rawne rolled himself up into a cleft of the ice cave and pulled the cloak around him. he felt only one thing. hate. somehow, somewhen, dawn had come up. thin, frail light poked into the cave. gaunt was asleep, huddled down under his cloak, covered in frost. rawne slowly got to his feet, fighting the ache in his bones and the almighty cold. the fire had long since gone out. he edged around the cave, staring down at gaunt. pain ebbed through his sewn leg, his shoulders, his mouth. the pain cleared the fuzziness of his head and made him sharp. he picked up his tanith knife, wiped the frost from it, and knelt to place its blade against gaunt's throat. no one would know. no one would ever find the body. and even if they did� gaunt shuddered in his sleep. he spoke the name of tanith twice as his eyelids rolled and flicked. then his voice died away into mumbling. rawne's hand tensed on the knife. he hesitated. gaunt spoke again, his dreaming voice a low monotone. tanith� in the name of the emperor all we have is a tomb. get enough of them around to pen us in and they'll bring the ice-cliff down and bury us. we have to move. and fast. more range, better sight. gaunt! gaunt cursed. now he understood what one of the gauges � the one with the rapidly dipping needle � really meant. the ork pursuit was closing. heavy bolter rounds and other explosive munitions rained down around them, blowing geysers of ice and steam up from the frozen sea. gaunt realised his naked, glove-less hands were beginning to freeze solid around the steering grips. the pain brought tears to his eyes, tears which froze behind his goggles and blurred his vision, biting his cheeks. two over-shot projectiles from the orks brought bigger explosions to the left of them. sprays of glutinous, boiling liquid erupted far into the air from their impacts. gaunt saw that the rushing landscape ahead of them was duller blue, more like frosted glass, cracked and crazed. they made the next rise. then the engine coughed, spluttered, died. they slid sideways in a long, wide deceleration, ice gouged up by gaunt's desperate use of the anchor. he kicked the starter. the engine flared once, then died forever in a cough of stinking oil smoke. dry rotors and cylinders burst and ground. the ork machines were a hundred metres behind them. they could hear them whooping in victory. for the first time, rawne realised that the wind was no longer screaming now they were out of the valley. what? gaunt pointed to where other wide shots from their pursuers dug steaming vents from the glassy ice. rawne understood the commissar's idea just as suddenly as he recognised the insanity of it. but the orks were only fifty paces away. rawne realised the desperation too. he had twelve stick mines in his satchel and he pulled them all out, handing half to gaunt. he kicked the glass off one of the vehicle's lamps and used the white-hot filament to light the fuses. the two humans took three in each hand and hurled them as far and as hard as they could, scattering them wide. twelve huge explosions, each big enough to kill a tank. they split the world apart. but more particularly, they burst and shattered the ice. the steaming hydrocarbon sea, so close beneath, rushed up to plume and boil and froth in the air. one ork machine cartwheeled, an explosion taking it over it tore itself and its occupants into fragments as it landed on ice that was beginning to separate and fracture in huge bobbing sections. another dodged the rain of blasts and flew straight off the edge of an ice chunk into the sea, where it vaporised and burned. the last stopped short, the riders bellowing, just missing a gap in the ice. then the ice chunk it sat on collapsed and they all dropped shrieking into the frothing, flaming liquid. the ice was coming apart, fracturing into chunks that burned and steamed as the rising ocean, locked in for so many thousands of years, welled up and conquered the surface. on the back of their dead machine, gaunt and rawne leapt and yelled in triumph until they realised the ice collapse was spreading their way fast. the ocean fizzed and thrashed up around their sled runners and the motor-sled dipped suddenly. gaunt jumped clear onto a nearby iceberg, newly formed and sizzling in the hideous liquid. he held out his hand. rawne jumped after him, grabbing gaunt's hand, allowing himself to be pulled clear as their ruined machine slid backwards into the liquid and exploded. it was true. their iceberg was rocking and dissolving like an ice cube in hot water. they leapt off it to the next, and then the next, hoping that the fractured sections of ice would remain intact long enough for them to reach some kind of shore. vapours gasped and billowed around them. on the fourth, rawne slipped and gaunt caught him just centimetres from the frothing water. they made the next floe and rawne moved ahead. he heard a cry behind him and turned to see the ice plate upending and gaunt sliding backwards on his belly, clawing the surface as he slipped down towards the seething ocean of hydrocarbons. he could let him die. rawne knew that. no one would know. no one would ever find the body. and even if they did� besides , he couldn't reach him. rawne pulled out his knife and hurled it. it stuck fast, blade down, in the tilting ice just above gaunt's hand and gave the commissar a grip. gaunt pulled himself up on the dagger and then got his foot braced on it until he could reach up and take rawne's hand. the major hauled him up high enough for the pair to make a safe jump to the next berg. this was larger, more solid. they clung to it, side by side, panting and out of strength. the ice chunk behind them fell back into the ocean, taking rawne's silver dagger with it. they sat together on top of the iceberg for six hours. around them, the ocean refroze and its seething hiss died away. but they could go nowhere. the reforming ice skin was but a few centimetres thick � thick enough to enclose the lethal liquid but not so hard as to bear weight. the distress beacon from gaunt's pack blinked and sighed behind them on the top of the ice chunk. rawne shook his head. the day will come, ibram gaunt. but it will be on equal terms. level terms, as you put it. i will kill you, and i will rejoice in it. gaunt pulled out his tanith knife, the knife given to him by corbec when they first mustered for war. rawne tensed, jerking back. but gaunt held it out to him, hilt first. rawne took the knife. the infirmary lay well back from the main embankment defence here on monthax. like gaunt's modular hut, it was raised out of the soupy ground on stacks. long, swoop-roofed, the infirmary's wall planking was washed an arsenic green, while the roof was black with bitumen. grey blast-curtains protected the doors and window hatches, and bunches of pipes and cables carried in air from the scrubbers and power from the chattering turbine behind the place. symbols of the imperium, and of the medical corps, were stencilled on the walls, for all that chaos would notice them if they stormed over the bulwark. gaunt climbed up a metal ladder next to the rush-ramp for stretcher parties, and pushed inside through the screens and heavy curtaining. inside he found a paradise and a surprise. it was by far the coolest and most fragrant place in the camp, probably the coolest, most fragrant place on monthax itself. sweet odours of sap rose from the fresh timber of the floor and the clean rush matting. there was a scent of antiseptic fluids, rubbing alcohol and some purifying incense that burned in a bowl next to the small shrine set near the western end. the forty beds were made up and empty. pale, artificial light shone from gauze-hooded lamps. gaunt wandered the length of the ward and let himself through a screen door at the end. there, access led off into storerooms, latrines, a small operating theatre, and the chief medical officer's quarters. dorden wasn't in his little, tidy office, but gaunt saw his distinctive handiwork in the careful arrangement of medical texts, chart folders, and the labels-front regimentation of the flasks and bottles in the locked dispensary cabinet. the medic was in the operating theatre, polishing the stain less-steel surface and blood drains of the theatre table. dorden smiled. he was a small, elderly man with a trimmed grey beard and genial eyes that had seen more pain than they deserved. it unnerves me, i have to say. seeing all those empty beds. i praise the golden throne i'm idle, but idleness doesn't suit me. gaunt nodded and left. he doubted he'd have time to stop by later, and he doubted too that this little paradise would remain unsullied much longer. dorden watched the commissar leave, and stood for a while longer surveying the clean ward with its empty cots. like gaunt, he had no illusions as to the horror-hole this place would become. it was inevitable. he closed his eyes, and for a moment he could see the floor matting drenched in black blood; the soiled sheets; the moaning, screaming faces. and the silent ones. his nostrils seemed to detect blood and burned flesh for a second, but it was just the incense. just the incense. eight blood oath the fallen men, scattered on the roadway and across the low, muddy fields of nacedon, looked like they were wearing black mail armour. but they weren't. the meat-flies were busy. they covered the flesh like seething black links of armour. tolin dorden looked away from the flies. the afternoon sky lay wide and misty over the low, flat fens. trackways and field boundaries were marked with dykes and hedge ways, all of them ruined and overrun with razor-posts, concertina wire and churned tank paths. the call again. sharp and insistent, from down the roadway. slowly, dorden turned and trudged from the gutter of the road where, for a hundred metres, more corpses lay twisted and crumpled and coated in flies. he advanced towards the buildings, feth, but he'd seen enough of this war now, no matter what the world. he was tired and he was spent. sixty years old, older by twenty years than any of the other ghosts. he was weary: weary of the death, the fighting, weary of the young bodies he had to patch back together. weary, too, of being regarded as a father by so many men who had lost their own at the fall of tanith. smoke clogged the late afternoon sky across the low fields. he approached the old red-brick buildings with their blown-out windows and crumpled walls. it had been a farm complex once, before the invasion. a feudal estate with a main house, outbuildings and barns. agricultural machinery lay rusting and broken in waterlogged swine pens. a wide trench gully and a double fence of seared flak-boards topped with more spools of wire enclosed the complex in a horseshoe, with the northern side, the one that faced away from the frontline, open. ghosts stood point all around, weapons ready. trooper brostin nodded him inside. dorden passed a sandbagged gunnery post from which the weapon had been hastily removed and entered the first of the buildings, the main house, through a doorway that had been shot out of the brick by sustained las-fire. more flies, billowing in clouds in the afternoon sunlight. the smell of death he was so, so used to. and other smells: antiseptic, blood, waste. dorden stepped across a tiled floor. half the tiles were broken, littered with glass and pools of oil that shimmered rainbow colours. corbec loomed out of the shadows nearby, shaking his weary head. dorden already knew as much. corbec led him through to a vaulted hallway. the various stenches were stronger in here. perhaps five dozen men lay on pallet beds in the chamber, half-lit by pallid yellow sunlight that streaked down through shattered lights in the sloping roof. dorden walked the length of the room and then back. dorden cursed quietly. volpone 50th. you remember those devils from voltemand? corbec asked. dorden looked round sharply. corbec groaned softly. he rubbed the top of his scalp, folding the thick black hair between his big, swarthy fingers. dorden was treating a leg wound when he heard the crunch of gravel on the roadway outside and the rumble of a troop carrier. he looked up to locate the source of the sound only after he had finished what he was doing. the boy was pale and sallow, too weak to rise from his pallet bed. dorden was sure that culcis would have wanted to punctuate that statement with an exclamation mark, but he was too weak to manage it. dorden said. gaunt turned away. for a moment, dorden thought the commissar might round on him and discipline him with a fist. but he didn't. instead, the man sighed. on reflection, dorden knew violence wasn't gaunt's first or chosen way of command. the endless war and his experience of other officer cadres in the field had soured dorden's expectation, something he wasn't proud of. gaunt took off his cap and smoothed his cropped blond hair. the dying suns-light silhouetted his angular profile, but kept his internal thoughts in shadow. gaunt replaced his cap. gaunt spat the answer and then fell silent. gaunt tried logic. no lie. we will retake this land, and beyond. we will drive them back as they come to us. think of the volpone wounded in there. gaunt cursed. gaunt strode away abruptly, then turned, came back and took dorden's hand tightly in his own. gaunt and the retreating lines of ghosts passed on and then they were alone. dorden was working in the long hall, and only noticed the passing of time as the sunshine through the skylights faded to blue and dusk fell. he lit lamps on crates placed between the wounded and went outside into the yard. overhead, alien stars were coming out in the mauve sky. he saw three ghosts at first: lesp, chayker and toskin, who acted as his orderlies and were skilled field medics. they were sorting through the medical supplies gaunt had left for them. dorden had half-expected them to volunteer and stay, hoped for it, but to see his three staffers working as usual was refreshing and uplifting. he crossed to them, meaning to carry on as normal and ask about the supply level, but all he found in his throat was thanks. each one smiled, took his hand as he offered it, grunted an acknowledgement of duty. dorden was proud of them. he started to give them dispersal instructions, and began to run through the needs of the sick in priority order, when other ghosts stepped into view: mkoll, the chief scout and dorden's closest friend in the unit, accompanied by troopers brostin, claig, caffran and gutes. they had just finished a patrol sweep of the horseshoe boundary and were preparing to dig in for the night.  dorden greeted mkoll. mkoll laughed. so, doc, you're in charge. night fell. the air cleared. distantly, carrion-dogs howled. three or more moons rose and set, duelling with each others' orbits. the darkness was clear and cold and smelled of death. far away, on the southern horizon, amber clouds thumped and boiled, a storm approaching. a mighty land army was moving towards them. that, and a real storm. lightning shuddered the sky in hazes of white-flash. the air became heavy and sweet. inside the farmhouse, one of the bluebloods spasmed and died. dorden was fighting for that life, his apron-smock slick with spurting blood. there was nothing he or lesp could do. lesp snorted. he'd been a fisherman back on the lost place, part of a sea-fishing family which plied the ocean currents beyond the archipelago. he owned a fierce skill with a sailcloth and net needle, and an almost surgical knack with a blade learned from gutting fish back in those days. dorden had put those skills to use in the name of healing when he had co-opted lesp as an orderly. lesp had taken to it well, and enjoyed his work alongside the chief medic. dorden took all the willing, able help he could get. most of the trained medics who had founded with the ghosts on tanith had never made it off-world. originally, the only fully qualified medics had been dorden, gherran and mtane, with twenty other troopers trained as field medics. dorden had interviewed and studied all of the surviving men to recruit for the badly needed medical staff. without devoted, constantly learning amateurs like lesp, foskin and chayker, the health of the regiment would have failed long ago. mtane and gherran had moved on with gaunt's main force, though both had wanted to stay. losing all three trained medics in one rash act was more than gaunt would tolerate. dorden stepped out into the muddy yard and, as if on cue, the heavens opened and sheeting rain hammered down on him, washing another's blood out of his tunic. he stood there, dripping, as the downpour eased a little. dorden swung round to face corbec, who was smoking a cigar in the cover of the slumping side-roof. all dorden could see was the shape and the red coal of the light. dorden crossed to him. corbec offered up a waxy box of smokes. dorden took two, slid one behind his ear unlit and lit up the other from corbec's half-smoked stick. they looked out into the night. dorden smiled. the cigar was strong and the flavour hellish, but he was enjoying it. it had been twenty years since he'd smoked. his wife had never approved, said it didn't set a good example to the patients dorden tended to. then the kids came along, mikal and clara, and he'd kicked the habit, so� dorden shut off the thoughts. tanith had taken his wife with it, and clara and her husband and their baby too. all he had was mikal, trooper mikal dorden, vox-caster operator in sergeant hasker's platoon. dorden broke his sad reverie. a door banged to their left. chayker, shrouded in his cape, emerged from the hospital and carried a tin drum over to the well. a few moments' cranking, and he struggled with it back to the buildings. dorden and corbec could already smell the broth chayker and foskin were brewing for all the company. thanks for the cigars. dorden had to take off more of the ruined leg from the shrieking regara with his handsaw before he could staunch and tie the haemorrhage. he directed tesp's sure fingers in to suture the breach with fine, sail-maker's stitches. by then, chayker had returned. dorden found he was mopping the floor with shredded strips from his cape tied to an old rake handle. for a ghost to tear up his treasured stealth cloak to mop blood � dorden's admiration for his volunteers' devotion to duty grew. they carried the softly moaning regara back to his bed. with luck, and a fever-breaking shot of mascetamine, he might yet live. but dorden was called away almost at once to a seizure that toskin couldn't cope with, and then to a man who had woken from near-coma, only to begin violently retching blood. the ward fell quiet towards midnight, as other dramas came and passed. dorden was scrubbing his chrome ribspreaders in a bucket of scalding water when mkoll came in, shaking the water from his cape. the storm was still booming outside and thunder rattled the casements and roofing. every now and then, loose glass in a window somewhere fell in, or tiles slipped off and shattered. the storm had continued all that evening, but until then, dorden had blanked it out. he watched mkoll sit and clean his gun, the first thing he always did before seeing to other duties like food or warmth. the thought of another home and family lost to the war now bit at him. he felt weary again. old. mkoll spooned his broth quietly. dorden fell silent. chaos had taken this world, nacedon, two months gone, as part of their counter-punch to thwart macaroth's crusade. it hadn't been occupied, or even corrupted from within. nacedon, an agricultural world with three million imperial colonists, had been violated and invaded in the space of three nights. what kind of universe was it, dorden wondered, where humans could struggle and break their backs and love their families and worship the emperor and build for years, only to lose it all in a few hours? his universe, he concluded, the same one that had taken tanith away. a late moon was up, a lonely sentry in a sky suddenly clear of storm. the rain had stopped and silver clouds scudded across the purple openness of the heaven. counterpart to the moon, a lone sentry stood at the gate of the station. trooper tremard, sitting his second shift at the gate in the sandbag emplacement, watched the tree lines, black fuzzes of darkness edging the flats of the equally black fields and fens. he was tired, and he wished that the fething volpone had left their heavy gun in the emplacement. mist rose across the fenland, drifting sideways like smoke. something twinkled in the dark. tremard started up, grabbing his scope from the sandbags. he fumbled with the focus ring, pulling the green-ongreen night vision view into true. mist � and other things in it. the twinkle he had seen. moonlight flashing back from the staring reflective retina of hunting eyes. he triggered his micro-bead link. corbec rose abruptly from his cot, like a dead man lifting from a grave, making dorden start. the colonel had been catching forty winks on a spare bed in the ward as the medic sorted pills into paper twists. dorden was up too. he looked around at the fragile hall, the vulnerable, half-dead men, as corbec readied his lasgun and voxed-in with the other troopers. dorden felt suddenly stupid. he knew what a full-on assault of chaos was like. they'd all be shattered like an egg-shell. he'd been stupid to insist on staying. now he had them all dead � the bluebloods, the ghosts� valuable, peerless ghosts like corbec and mkoll. he'd wasted them all, over some foolish pride in an old oath. an old medical oath, taken in safer times, in a nice community practice where the worst injury was a laceration at the sawmill. feth me for a fool! feth me for my pride! dorden swallowed, thinking of the work it would take him and lesp to carry sixty-seven men out into the rear of the dwelling on stretchers. he heard the distant wail of las-fire and realised it wouldn't be half the effort corbec and his soldiers were about to make. tremard held the gate. dark shapes moved across the fields and through the dim hedgerows towards him, crackling out green pulses of laser fire and white-hot bolt rounds. the treacherous moon showed movement and the occasional glint of armour, and he picked his targets well, barking orange slices of laser into the open fenland beyond the farm. ducking the incoming sprays of fire, a figure dropped into the position beside him. it was colonel corbec. corbec grinned at tremard, made some obscene remark as to the maternal origins of the enemy that had tremard cackling at its vulgarity, and leaned up over the bags to loose a volley of shots from his lasgun down the lane into the fens. along the ditch walls, the other ghosts opened up.  eight las guns against the encroaching dark, eight lasguns picking their targets through scope and skill, matching the hundreds of fire-points blasting back at them from the fens. a second later, his query was lost in a withering assault which blasted down the lane and onto his position. a hundred or more warriors of chaos were forcing their approach at the main gate, charging them, weapons blazing. corbec and tremard could see nothing but the light-blur of their guns. corbec ducked under the intense volley. he didn't even curse. it was over, he knew. the end of colm corbec. by his side, tremard, a second too late in ducking, flew backwards, his left arm gone in a shredded waste of flesh below the shoulder, he fell on his back, screaming and writhing. his lasgun, with his left hand still holding the grip, sat miraculously on the parapet where he had rested it. corbec scrambled to him, under the hideous rain of bolt and las-fire, grabbing the struggling man and holding him close. he had to calm him and make him still before he could tie up that awful stump. if he lived that long. tremard screamed and screamed, fighting like a scalded cat, drenching corbec and himself with the pumping arterial spray of his stump. corbec glanced up to see black forms in quilted armour, faces covered by gas-hoods, scrambling over the lip of the sandbags towards him. he could smell their rank animal scent, and the badges of the dark gods blazoned on their armour burned in his mind even at a glimpse and turned his stomach. there was a double click, dry and solid, and then a whoosh of heat as the night lit up. corbec winced. trooper brostin stood over him, raking the tops of the sandbags and the lane beyond with his flamer. the hurricane force of the flame gout cut the enemy away like dry grass. dorden and lesp were halfway through transporting the injured into the rear of the house when the call came through. stray shots were punching through the ward hall, exploding rafters and shattering wall-plaster and brick. any more of corbec's message was lost in crackling static, drowned by the gunfire. lesp yelled over the onslaught as he disappeared. dorden smiled at the young man's bravery. pain was slashed into the blueblood's thin face. dorden called on the link. he didn't wait for an answer. using chayker's mop as a crutch, culcis scurried out into the yard and made the inner wall, where caffran was blasting through a fire-slot. a nod, and caffran gave up his gun and position to the blueblood. culcis settled in, leaning against the flak-boards, and resumed blasting. in three minutes, dorden had substituted three more volpones on the defence line, men with leg wounds or head wounds, but able-bodied. in return, he got claig, gutes and foskin. dorden told foskin the drill, and foskin supervised the five able-bodied ghosts into a slick pattern of removing the wounded into the rear sections of the house. shaken by the onslaught which lit up the feeble night dorden reached the gatepost, running in a stoop. brostin and corbec were blasting away. brostin was now using tremard's lasgun, switching to the big flamer every time the assault became too great. dorden knelt by tremard, assessed his injury and set to work. dorden yelled at corbec. as dorden and brostin carried tremard back to the farmhouse, corbec held the gate. dorden's last view of him was clear: the huge tanith warrior his hair loose and flowing in the night wind as the storm came down again, crackling and flashing, flamer in one hand, lasgun in the other, dealing death to anything that moved. the enemy assault had pivoted to the western side of the horseshoe, and heavy fire slammed against the flakboarding, throwing some sheets up out of the muck and shattering them mkoll felt more than saw the change in emphasis and rushed from his position at the east end to support chayker and a blueblood called vengo who had substituted for gutes. chaos soldiers were pushing through the holes in the outer flak-board wall and the three guardsmen, firing single, aimed shots to preserve power on corbec's orders, dropped dozens into the slime pit of the ditch. soon bodies blocked the fence holes as well as the missing boards had done. well enough when they come at us with boltguns and las-weapons, mkoll thought to himself darkly. but what do we do when they bring up flamers, meltas, grenades� or worse? the cacophony of the assault was ear-splitting and a double echo rolled back to them from the wide fens like thunder, almost as loud as the real thing. the storm or the storming shook the earth, and mkoll wasn't sure which. vengo, bandaged up with a gut wound, found his strength failing and his vision swimming. the majesty and fury of the open assault, the desperation and the frantic effort, had quite numbed him to the dull pain of his injuries, but they were telling on him none the less. drenched by the downpour, he tried to reposition himself, changing spent clip for fresh with cold, wet hands. the fresh power clip slipped away and dropped into the mud under his feet. he stooped. a soldier of chaos, cut down and presumed dead in the ditch, had crawled forward, and now loomed over the inner fence above the scrabbling volpone. his chest had been blasted open, and blood and tissue dribbled from exposed ribs. his gas-hood was also gone, revealing the fanged snout and grey hide of his corrupted face. he swung up a rusty entrenching tool. chayker, dazzled by the volleys of las-light and the strobe effect of the lightning, saw his assailant in a flash of white, frozen mid-swing. he wrenched his lasgun out of the fire-slot and blasted down the gully, blowing the attacker out over the fence. rising with the recovered clip, deafened by the sensory overload of the storm and fighting, vengo had no idea how he had been spared or how close he had been to death.  bolt rounds drummed into the flak-boards around mkoll's slot, and nailed wooden splinters into his cheek and neck. he cried out and dropped back for a second. rubbing at the bloody grazes in his face, he moved back to the slot, re-aiming. other dark shapes were stirring in the filth at the bottom of the ditch. vengo's close call had been a warning. even killing shots didn't seem to finish all of these abominations. many of those that they had cut down were far from dead, and now were crawling and clambering up to attack the inner fence. he yelled over the comm-link to chayker and vengo. he had a few tube-charges left, and he hefted three over the inner fence into the ditch with its half-seen stirrings. mkoll voxed. vengo caught the hint at once, and lowered his aim to pick off two more of the supposed dead who were writhing through the mire towards him. others clustered around the breaches in the outer fence, cut down by the trap as fast as they gathered and pressed in. how many of them are there out there? chayker wondered. the force of the assault seemed to be increasing with every moment. on the eastern turn of the horseshoe, culcis held the line with his other two volpone substitutes, drado and speers. brostin had returned from his stretcher run to the house and fell in beside culcis, hefting a misfiring volpone heavy stubber he'd found leaning against the wall in the long hall. it had a drum of sixty rounds left in it, and he'd resolved to use them all before switching to his laspistol. his flamer was in corbec's meaty hands at the gate. all they could hear or see from the gate area, at the southern point of the horseshoe, were belches of flame and laschatter and corbec's increasingly colourful exclamations over the vox-link. brostin settled in, getting to know the unfamiliar stubber. its cyclic rate was poor and it jammed frequently, but when it fired, the thump and blast was satisfying. me shredded half a dozen shapes that loomed beyond the outer fence. at the eastern side, the tree-line and woods were closer than at the west, which looked out over fenland interrupted only by hedges and dykes. here, the enemy was on them with little warning, rushing out of the trees to assault the double fence and the ditch. brostin found himself admiring the shooting skills of the blueblood culcis. arrogantly, against corbec's orders, he had adjusted the power setting to full and was firing off searing orange blasts. but each one counted. his eye's as good as mad larkin's, thought the heavy-set ghost, and that's a real compliment. drado and speers were doing their part too, but drado's aim was off. though able-bodied, the man had a head wound and one eye bandaged. the lack of binocular range-finding was ruining his shot. brostin said fiercely, fist raised. drado hauled himself up and spat at brostin. drado didn't answer. he set to firing again, and brostin noted with approval that he was compensating now and favouring the left side. he made hits. inside rut manor house, dorden checked the state of the wounded they had moved. with the help of tesp, gutes, caffran, toskin and claig, he had transferred the patients back, one at a time, through to the rear chambers and then down in the long undercroft. this low, vaulted cellar space was made of thick stone. the best protection they could afford. they might survive the attack here � or be buried like rats. with foskin's help, he treated tremard's wound and got him stable. then he ordered all the ghosts back out to the defence, all except tesp, whom he needed. another comatose volpone had woken during the rough relocation and was convulsing. caffran, toskin, gutes and claig made their way up the cellar steps, taking their pick of the broken volpone weapons stacked in the stable-block on their way to rejoin the defence. the convulsing volpone died. though he showed no outward signs of injuring except severe bruising, dorden knew his innards had been turned to jelly by artillery concussion. lesp helped him haul the corpse back up the undercroft stairs and dump it in the hall. they went back down. the undercroft was damp and pun gent, lit by hissing chemical lamps the ghosts had set up hurriedly. the injured moaned and sighed. some slept like they were dead. the earth around them all shook and trickles of liquid mud spurted down from the roof every now and then as the onslaught rattled the foundations of the house. lesp asked, his voice clear and certain. dorden stammered for a moment, lost for words. he thought, desperately, what gaunt might say in such circumstances. what would a trained political officer do here, trying to raise the spirits of men looking death in he face? he couldn't do it. it wasn't in him. instead, all he could manage was something entirely personal. their memories lost with me. dorden turned towards the stairs. tesp asked. tesp pulled out his laspistol and offered it, butt-first, to the chief medic. dorden shook his head. upstairs, the old ruin was quiet. it seemed as if the storm and the assault had abated together for the moment. dorden edged into the vacated long hall and tried his micro-bead but it was dead. the ceiling lamps swung and loose debris fluttered down. tree of bodies, the stinking cots looked pitiful and sadly spoiled. dorden stepped over pools of blood and shreds of discarded clothing. he strode into the outer kitchen, looking once at the stained table where he had excised a part of regara's leg. he saw the old fireplace for the first time. black iron, just like the one he had sat before at home on tanith.  he and his wife, at the end of a long night, with a book and a glass of something warming, before the grate-light. along the mantle, small blocks of what looked like chalk sat in a row. he moved over and took one in his hand. a tusk. the small, shed tusk of a pig. the inhabitants of this manor, whoever they were, had raised swine, cared for them enough to treasure the trophies of their growth and development. pig teeth, each marked in a delicate hand with a name� emperor, sire, his lordship� and dates. this touch of frugal humanity, the day-to-day chronicle of a farmstead, affected him deeply. it wasn't mawkish, it mattered somehow. why pigs? who had lived here, raised the swine, toiled in the fens, brought up a family? a sound from the long hall brought him up to the surface of his thoughts. he moved back to meet a gaggle of men as they limped and blundered in through the hall doors from the outside. the volpone substitutes and the ghosts, all except corbec. they were shell-shocked and dazed, weary on their feet. dorden found mkoll at the rear of the group. get below, into the undercroft, all of you. foskin � lesp will help you cook up some food for all. do it! artillery or not, i want everyone sustained. mkoll said there was an old shrine out back of this place. corbec raised the lamp and read off the inscription. with that last remark, corbec flung his hand towards the reredos' inscription. corbec nodded. dorden stiffened, knowing somehow what must come next. dorden looked round at corbec in wonder. gaunt nodded and moved off into the manor house ruin. corbec turned to dorden and showed him the pig's tooth he had clutched in his hand. , he whirled his lasgun in time to his rhythmic chant, snapping it round, clutching it horizontally, lunging forward and killing the bole of one of the trees over and again. after each strike, he tugged it free with effort, and repeated the drill. the trunk was slashed and puckered, oozing orange sap from the wounds left by his nimble work. caffran snapped around, realising he was being watched. caffran felt tongue-tied, as he always did when gaunt addressed him directly. he still, after all this time, had mixed feelings about the commissar who had both saved them and made them ghosts in the same action. caffran! domor pointed up into the spray-fog at something only his augmented vision could resolve, and then only barely. two more bodies flung themselves down next to them, then a third. trooper mkendrik with his flamer; trooper chilam, missing an ear and yowling like a cat as he dabbed his salty hand at the bloody hunk of cartilage on the side of his head. and then, sergeant varl. varl was a popular officer amongst the ghosts; young, field-promoted from the rank of trooper, a wise-cracking, hard-nosed bastard refreshingly lacking all the airs and graces of the officer class. he'd lost his shoulder on fortis binary, and his black tunic bulged over the cybernetic joint the medics had given him. it was clear to caffran that the sergeant was in some pain. varl cursed and struggled with his artificial shoulder. sea-water had soaked into the shoulder joint, shorting out servos and fusing linkages. his arm was dead and useless, but still the raw neural connections transmitted flickers of shorting electrical failure to his brain. domor had been lucky. his ocular units had been sealed into his skull enough to prevent such damage� though caffran wondered how long it would take the insidious touch of seawater corrosion to blind the man. with mkendrik's help, caffran stripped off varl's tunic and unscrewed the bolts on the small inspection plate in varl's metal shoulder blade. with the point of his tanith dagger, mkendrik prised out the flat battery cells revealed there, cutting the electrical relay which governed the limb. varl sighed as his arm went dead and caffran strapped it up, tight against the sergeant's body. it was a desperate gesture. without the booster relay of the cells, not only all neural control, but all life support would be cut from the organic parts of varl's repaired arm. he needed proper help, or within an hour or two his now-lifeless arm would begin to decay and perish. for now, though, the sergeant was grateful, he scrambled over, supporting himself on his one good hand, and took a look over the cover-line. along the beach, under the downpour of fire, men were coming ashore. most were dying; some were making it to cover. varl wailed. caffran scoped around, and saw heavy basilisk tanks half-submerged, struggling up the beach a hundred metres away. varl looked where caffran pointed. varl spat. a whinnying bolt round ricocheted off the top of the groyne's solid woodwork and took chilam straight in the face, exploding his head. he flew back onto the shingle, full length. varl yelled. micro-bead chatter, discordant and contradictory, rasped in their ears. the spume of the spray-mist was receding, and now they could see what he saw. the vast white curtain wall of oskray island's sea-defences rose ahead of them, almost a kilometre high. apart from some stray scorch marks, it was unblemished. the basilisks had been meant to flatten it and break through for the infantry. but the wall still stood, impassive, cold, like a denial of any possible future. varl cursed. caffran heard the protesting wail first. he looked back out to sea, then grabbed domor and varl and threw them flat into the painful jumble of the shingle. mkendrik dived down too. a troop-ship, one of the great fat beetles, on fire from end to end, was coming in low, half-sidelong, nose down, spilling burning fuel and shreds of fuselage. it was huge, blocking out the sky, six hundred tonnes of dying metal keening in towards the beach over their heads. its jaw-hatches were still closed. men are cooking in there, caffran thought, wondering which regiment, and then, as it came down on top of his head, his thoughts guttered out like a candle flame in a hurricane. mkendrik shook him awake. caffran stirred, and woke up into the roar of the assault. caffran struggled up out of the shingle. it had felt like hours, like all his fatigue and pain had overwhelmed him and sent him to sleep. at first there was little to see. the white steam and mist had become fouled with black smoke, and the ashy curls of it, thick with glowing cinders, enveloped the beach. then, caffran made out more.  the stricken troop-ship had slammed over them, coming to rest at the head of the beach where the last few seconds of its crashflight had been broken by the fortified seawall of oskray island. the impact had blown the wall in. for six hundred metres, its immeasurably old and solid stone was fused and fractured. a blackened chasm had opened into the heart of the refinery. the men aboard that troop-ship had brought a way into the target with their lives as surely as if they had fought their way up the beach. caffran gathered scattered items which had split from his burst pack, and recovered his fallen lasgun. mkendrik was changing las-cells. a short way off, varl and domor were making ready, and small groups of ghosts in foxholes along the beach were also preparing to make use of this new way in. enemy fire still strafed down from the wall, though it was thinner now such a chunk of the wall had gone. the incoming troop-ships, still roaring and settling over the tide-line behind them, were jockeying into this blind spot to avoid the tracking fire from the main batteries on the cliffs. caffran heard thunder, and turned to see four basilisks hoving up the beach, properly delivered, moving past them into the breach and tracking to fire. they sizzled up wet stone flecks as they rolled, cranking their huge, decorated bulks up and over the groynes. caffran recognised the markings. ketzoks, the 17th armoured regiment, the so-called serpents who had been gulled into slaughtering them back on voltemand. with varl, domor, mkendrik and several others, caffran moved in towards the breach, running over stone litter and smouldering fragments of blackened mechanicals, the last remnants of the troop-ship. stray las-shots winged down at them and stubber rounds rattled with a curious clack-clack sound off the stone facings to their left. entering the chasm in the wall, caffran passed into deep shadow. ahead, one hundred metres down the v-shaped channel blasted by the crash, a dimness loomed. he felt a sense of pride. they would be the first � the ghosts would be the first to break through the stalwart defences of the target. he was close to the far end now, stumbling with the others through the shadow, picking his way around mangled hull fragments. ahead, the dimness was becoming a forest of steel and iron. the refinery itself. gaunt had been precise in his briefing. the fleet could have vaporised oskray island from orbit, but it was too valuable. that meant a land assault to retake it from the legions of chaos. the vile host here called themselves the kith, some hive-fermented sub-cult of khorne� caffran had blanked on some of the briefing's complexities, partly because it was alien gibberish to him, and partly because the gibberish made him feel ill. he didn't want to listen to the details concerning the filth they were going up against. the kith: that was all he focussed on. the kith were the sub-human vermin he was here to eradicate. their leader was a monster called sholen skara. fragments of the chaos armada stopped at balhaut had run to sapiencia for shelter, and their leaders had conjoined with a chaos cult already thriving in the underclass of the vast hive to overthrow imperial rule and seize the fuel-oil and promethium wells. colonel-commissar gaunt had spoken long and passionately about the kith in his briefing. caffran knew gaunt had been part of the great balhaut victory, back when he was still a political officer with the hyrkan eighth. gaunt loathed all chaos, but loathed especially the tendrils of it which had escaped destruction at balhaut only to twist and pollute other worlds, thanks, as he saw it, to the tactical miscalculations of warmaster macaroth. gaunt had spoken of sholen skara, renegade of the balhaut murder-camps, as if he had known him personally. that was why the colonel-commissar had volunteered his ghosts for the oskray assault. he had made it plain to them all. and that, mused caffran, was why they had been drowned and blasted and torn apart on the razor-wire. caffran often thought about gaunt. ibram gaunt. he rolled the name in his mind, a name he would never dare voice aloud. the colonel, the commissar. a strange man, and caffran's feelings for him were strange too. he was the best, most caring, most charismatic leader caffran could imagine. caffran had seen, time and again, the way gaunt looked after the ghosts. caffran had also seen enough of other regiments and their commanders and politicos to know how rare a thing that was. many, like beloved colonel corbec, regarded gaunt as a saviour, a friend, a brother, and caffran could not deny he admired gaunt and would follow him to the ends of any earth. but caffran knew feygor, rawne and the other malcontents well, and in bitter moments he shared their contempt for the colonel-commissar. for all his fatherly love, like their own private emperor, gaunt had left tanith to die. prom time to time, caffran had been tempted to throw aside his reservations about gaunt and worship him as so many others did. but always, that creeping resentment in his heart had stopped him from total devotion. gaunt was ruthless, calculating, direct. he would never stint from sending men to their deaths, for his duty was to the emperor and the rule of terra long before it was to the lost souls of tanith. caffran saw the boy milo, the so-called adjutant, as a constant reminder of the lost youth of his homeworld. milo was only a year or two younger than caffran, but a gulf divided them. he never spoke to the boy. gaunt, in his oh-so generous wisdom, had saved milo from the fires of tanith magna. saved one � but no one else. caffran thought, at such times, of laria. how he had loved her. how very much. all caffran knew for sure was that laria was dead now. how she had died he had no idea, and frankly, he was thankful for that. but laria haunted him. laria embodied everything he had lost. tanith itself, his friends, his life, his family. for laria's sake, caffran knew he would always remain one of those ghosts in the middle way, one who would follow gaunt to hell devoutly, but would never forgive him when they arrived. here, in the wall gully of oskray, it was easy to hate gaunt. the stink of death and fire filled the place. caffran slid in low against a fallen tower of stone blocks as he approached the opening into the island proper. varl, mkendrik and trooper vulliam dropped in beside him. behind them, down the crash-chasm at the mouth of the breach, caffran could hear shouts and grinding tracks. the sergeant said. varl chortled. varl signalled the advance beyond the breach gap, and fifty-nine ghosts rose from cover and moved forward. vulliam, two metres ahead of caffran, was one of the first to break into the open. stub rounds broke him messily into four. six more ghosts died as they broke cover. though hammered, the kith had their side of the chasm in the wall soundly covered. caffran fell back with the others as las-rounds and bolts and stub charges peppered the exit of the breach. in cover, they lay trembling as the deadly rain continued to drum the opening ahead. vision's a little foggy. got water in there. hope� might as well have left this fething wall standing for all tin-good trooper callun said. varl nodded, nursing his strapped arm. his laspistol, the only weapon he could handle now, lay in his lap. fuega stepped back. he got up to face the ketzok corporal. orders from general kline. fuega turned away. the ghosts sat in a stupefied gaggle. varl was angry. varl spat and sighed. caffran called varl over, and a group of ghosts gathered to look up. supposed trooper haven. but the cliff is ragged and full of good handholds. the first man up could secure a line. sergeant, it's a plan� he was a tall, barrel-chested man with a boxer's nose. varl nodded. he began to round up the walking wounded, and seconded several able bodies to help him with the more seriously injured. gorley selected his commando squad: caffran, domor, mkendrik, haven, tokar, bude, adare, mkallun, caill. mkendrik, raised in the mountains of tanith steeple, led off, clambering up the splintered wall, hand over hand. he left his flamer and its tanks with gorley, to raise them later on a line. by the time the ascent was made, and ropes secured, their leeway was almost up, and the ten ghosts were alone in the chasm. within moments, the basilisks at the throat of the breach would start their bombardment. the men went up quickly, following the ropes. gorley was last, securing a line around the flamer unit and other heavy supplies. the team at the top, crowded into the splintered doorway, hauled them up. gorley was halfway up the ascent when the bombardment began. the nine ghosts above cowered into the shelter of the concrete passageway they had climbed into and covered their ears at the concussion. a shell hit the wall and vaporised gorley, as if he had never been there. realising he was gone, caffran urged the party to collect their equipment and move inwards. soon this entire wall section would be brought down. the ghost squad crept up the unlit passageway. though generally intact, the tunnel had slumped a little following the massive shockwave from the troop-ship crash. the ground was split in places, exposing crumbling rock. pipes and cables dangled from the cracked roof; dust trickled down from deep fissures. in places, the shock-impact had sectioned the wall, cutting the originally straight and horizontal tunnel into a series of cleanly stepped slabs. the tanith clambered on, probing the dusty darkness with the cold green glare of assault lamps. behind them, the stonework of the great sea wall began to shake. the ketzok had redoubled their furious work. caffran found himself leading, as if there had been an unspoken vote electing him in gorley's place. he presumed it was because he had suggested this incursion in the first place. the ghosts picked up their speed and moved deeper into the tunnel system that threaded the marrow of the wall. they reached a vertical communications shaft, down the centre of which ran a great wrought-iron spiral staircase. the air was damp and smelled of wet brick and the sea. shock damage was evident here too, and the bolts securing the metal stairway and its adjoining walkways to the shaft-sides had sheared off or snapped. the entire metal structure, hundreds of tonnes of it filling the shaft, creaked uneasily with each shuddering impact from the guns of the distant basilisks. the ghosts stepped across the metal landing of the stair-coil to where the tunnel resumed beyond. it squealed and yelped with every step, sometimes threatening to tilt or fall. caill and flaven were last across. a metal bolt-end the size of a man's forearm rang off the gantry, just missing caill. it had come loose far above. yelled caffran. with a protesting, non-vocal scream, the staircase collapsed, tearing itself apart and rattling away down into the black depths of the bottomless shaft. where larger parts of the structure remained intact � a few turns of steps laced together, a long section of handrail, a series of stanchion poles � they fell with heavy fury, raking sparks and hideous shrieks from the shaft walls. empty, the stairs fallen away, the brick shaft seemed immense, uncrossable.  domor looked back at the tunnel they had come along, out of reach now across the gulf. every sixty metres, tunnels bisected the main route on the inland side: deep, wide throats of brick and concrete that sloped downwards. mkendrik thought they might be drainage channels, but if that was true, the size alarmed caffran. they were big enough to take a man walking upright and just as broad. if that kind of liquid quantity flooded these tunnels from time to time� domor believed the channels to be for personnel movement, or for running carts of ammo and supplies up to the emplacements buried in the sides and along the top of the great sea wall. but they'd seen no vertical cargo shafts for munitions lifting, and caffran doubted sheer manpower could roll enough shells up the sloping channels without mechanical assistance. and they had met no one, not a trace of the kith soldiery, not even a corpse. caffran thought it a fair bet. caffran paused. getting in, that had been everything. the main internal lock for the hatch is buried inside the frame. those crosses mark the threads of the gears. he was trying to bring back the briefing. the commissar had shown them aerial views of the oskray facility, concentrating on the sea wall area they were meant to assault. he tried to picture the other, inner derrick areas he had glimpsed. towers, dozens of them, just like the one on which they stood, bridging to each other at various levels, including some higher than the sea wall. if that was true � if the memory was true � they could cross to other towers higher up as well as lower down. they ascended. caffran fought the panic in his mind. the way in, the chance to sneak inside, had seemed a good plan, a brave plan, but now they were here, eight men alone in a city of the enemy, he had no idea what they had even expected to be able to achieve. there was no plan, not even the raw materials for a plan. he dreaded any of the others asking him to explain their purpose here. fire from below; three or four storeys down, squads of kith soldiery were moving up the tower, blasting upwards. las-rounds popped and thumped through the mesh steps around them. mkallun lost the front of his foot and toppled, screaming in pain. adare, just a few steps below him, arrested his fall and hauled the whimpering man up with him. the others blasted downwards and an odd vertical firefight began, laser salvos spitting up and down the tower structure. mkendrik, last of the ascending ghosts, hosed the stairs below them with his flamer and belching clouds of fire drizzled down through the open metal edifice and torched the closest of the pursuers. six more flights up, a bridging walkway opened to their left, crossing the smoky chasm to another tower. there seemed to be no one on the other structure, and caffran gestured the men across, stopping to help adare with mkallun. adare grabbed caffran's shoulder and pointed to the swiftly ascending elevator in the tower they were leaving. it was packed with enemy troopers, climbing far faster than those on the stairs. caffran sent adare hobbling onwards with mkallun, then pulled a pair of tube-charges from his pack. he set short fuses and rolled them along the bridge onto the tower deck, then ran to join the others. the blast tore through the tower assembly, blowing out stanchions and main-supports all around. with a deafening howl, the tower crumpled and collapsed, hundreds of metres of steeple section from above sliding down with almost comical slowness, splintering the body of the tower below. the packed elevator car fell like a stone. power servos tore out and exploded. secondary explosions rippled out into the gloom. the collapse tore away the bridge they had just crossed by, and ripped the bridge supports out of their side of the crossing, shearing metal and girders around them, shaking the other tower. heavier impacts shook them as bridges higher up tore loose with the descending tumult and came slamming or dragging down the length of their tower. from below, as the tower mass crashed to the ground, other explosions fluttered out as fuel stores and pumps detonated under the impact. plumes of fire gusted around them. caffran wasn't sure. in desperation, he hadn't really thought through the consequences of mining the tower. one simple thing occurred to him. now they moved downwards, partly because down seemed to make sense, and partly because none of them trusted the stability of the tower now that its neighbour had been torn so brutally away. they descended into thicker, blacker smoke. bright cinders floated on the wind and there was a deep, rank smell of burning fuel and spilt promethium. even from here, they knew the collapsing tower had done vast damage to the plant. down, thought caffran. still he had no plan he could speak of, but down seemed to be instinctively right. what could they do here except perhaps some small, specific act? like� take out the kith's command cadre. he laughed to himself as he thought the words. bold, ridiculous words. as if they could even find sholen skara and his seniors in an island-hive this size. but it was a notion worth hanging on to. a few hundred metres from the ground, he instructed his men to work stealthily, to do what the ghosts did best. they blackened their skin with soot from the handrails, and pulled down their camo-cloaks, melting into the darkness of the smoke and the blackened tower-scaffold. below them, around the base of the tower, twisted, burning wreckage lay scattered five hundred metres in every direction flames leapt from small lakes of petroleum and mineral gels the debris from the fallen tower, some of it great chunks of tower-section intact and twisted on the concrete, crushed beneath it smaller buildings and storage blocks, cranes and other rig service vehicles. charred bodies lay crumpled or burst here and there. they passed at least one section of walkway dangling from their tower like a loose flap, clanking as it swung back and forth against the girders. reedy klaxons barked through the smoke like the sound of yapping guard dogs. they strode out from the base of the tower into the wreckage in fire-team formation, caffran and tokar at point. domor supported the hopping mkallun; caffran wasn't going to leave him behind. spools of chain, frayed wire hawsers, splashes of oil and metal litter covered the concourse. caffran skirted around a pair of kith corpses, men who had clung together as they fell and been mangled into one hideous ruin by the ground. sending mkendrik ahead in his place, caffran dropped back to check on domor and mkallun. a hefty shot of analgesic had left mkallun vacant, lolling and useless. domor was blind. the iris shutters on his bionic implants had finally failed and shut tight. filmy fluid leaked around the focussing rings and wept down his face. it hurt caffran to see his friend like this. it was like menazoid epsilon all over again, when domor had lost his eyes and still fought on without them, playing his part with a valour and tenacity even gaunt had been awed by. caffran shook his head. he wiped away the sweat that beaded his brow and trickled down the blue dragon tattoo on his temple.  caffran opened mkallun's pack and took out a one-shot plastic injector of adrenaline, stamping it into mkallun's bare forearm. the injured trooper roared as he came out of his stupor. caffran slapped him. mkallun growled and then spat and nodded as he understood. the adrenaline rush was killing all his pain and refortifying his limbs. they moved on. beyond the area of debris, the hive complex was a warren of drum silos and loading docks, redwashed girder towers marked with the imperial eagle and then defaced with sickening runes of chaos. in one open concourse there was a row of fifty cargo trucks, flatbeds, smashed and burned out. along one wide access ramp, millions of sections of broken pipe and hose, scattered in small random mounds. inside one damaged silo, countless pathetic bodies were piled and jumbled: a mass grave of those oskray workers who would not join skara's cause. so flaven suggested. enemy insignia there, and armour. caffran agreed with flaven's incredulity, but the signs were there. what purpose� what peculiar intent lay behind this charnel heap? they heard shots, a ripple of las-fire from beyond the silo and swung in close, moving with the shadows. more shots, another almost simultaneous volley. perhaps� a hundred guns, thought caffran? he ordered them to stay down and crept forward with adare. what they saw beyond the next bunker shocked them. there was wide concourse, almost a kilometre square, at the heart of this part of the island complex. from the markings on the ground, this had been a landing pad for the cargo lighters. across the centre, a thousand kith soldiers stood in ranks of one hundred. facing them was a messy litter of bodies which tractors with fork shovels and dozer blades were heaping into freight trucks. caffran and adare watched. the front rank of the kith took twenty steps forward and turned to face the other rows. at a signal from a nearby officer, what was now the front rank raised their weapons and cut the file of a hundred men down in an uneven burst of gunfire. as the tractors pushed the bodies aside, the rank that had fired stepped forward and marched to where their targets had been. they turned, waited. another order. another ripple of fire. caffran thought for a moment, reaching into his memory to recover the parts of the briefing he had blanked. the parts where gaunt had spoken about sholen skara. it came back to him, out of the darker reaches of his mind, recollections rising like marsh-gas bubbles out of the mire of forgetfulness. suddenly, gaunt's voice was in his ear, gaunt's image before him. the briefing auditorium of the mighty troop-ship persistence, gaunt, in his long storm coat and cap, striding onto the dais under the stone lintel of the staging, glancing up at the gilt spread-eagle with its double heads on the velvet drop behind him. gaunt, removing his coat and dropping it on the black leather chair, standing there in his dress jacket, taking off his cap once to smooth his cropped hair as the men came to order. gaunt, speaking of the abominations and filthy concepts caffran had blanked from his mind. the names of the foul species of chaos that sholen skara had commanded, the symbolic meaning of their crimes. now though, he understood why ibram gaunt, champion of human life and soldier of the divine emperor, would so personally loathe the likes of the monster called skara. gaunt coughed at the word as if his gorge was rising, and a murmur of revulsion passed through the assembled ghosts. caffran's mind swam round to the present. kith soldiers, in their hundreds, were marching out onto the concourse to fall in behind the rows already slaughtered. not slaughtered, thought caffran: harvested. it reminded him of the rows of corn stooks back on the meadows of tanith, as the mechanical threshers came in reaping row after row. despite the sickness in his stomach, a sickness that pinched and viced with each echo of gunfire, caffran smiled. caffran grinned again. he realised he did have a plan, after all. and he'd already executed it. when he'd brought that tower crashing down, he'd made sholen skara believe a significant enemy force was inside oskray hive. made him believe that defeat loomed. as a result, skara was ordering the kith to kill themselves, one hundred at a time. one hundred every thirty seconds. caffran sat back. his aching body throbbed. there was a las-burn across his thigh he hadn't even noticed before. said adare, perplexed. afternoon squalls from the ocean were clearing the smoke from oskray hive, but even the wind and rain couldn't pry the stink of death from the great refinery. formations of imperial gunships shrieked overhead, pummelling the rain clouds with their fire-wash. gaunt found caffran asleep amongst several hundred other ghosts under a tower piling. the young trooper snapped to attention as soon as he realised who had woken him. they crossed the great concourse of the refinery city, passing squads of ghosts, volpone and abberloy guardsmen detailed at building-to-building clearance. shouts and whistles rang commands through the air as the imperial forces took charge of the island hive and marshalled ranks of dead-eyed prisoners away. caffran shrugged. gaunt stopped and turned to smile at the young ghost. caffran laughed. he followed gaunt into a blockhouse of thick stone where oil-drum stacks had been packed aside to open a wide space. sodium lamps burned from the roof.  a ring of imperial guardsmen edged the open area; volpone mostly, but there were some ghosts, including rawne and other officers. in the centre of the open area, a figure kneeled, shackled. he was a tall, shaven-headed man in black, tight-fitting robes. powerful, caffran presumed, had he been allowed to stand. his eyes were sunken and dark, and glittered out at gaunt and caffran as they approached from the edge of the guarding circle. caffran's eyes opened wide. he gazed down. gaunt pulled out his bolt pistol, checked it, cocked it and offered it to caffran. caffran took the proffered gun and looked down at skara. gaunt snapped. gaunt thought for a moment. he smiled. behind them, skara screamed and begged and pleaded and shrieked. and lived to do so, again and again. brin milo, gaunt's young adjutant, brought the commissar a tin cup of caffeine brew and the data-slates he hadn't requested � though he had been about to. gaunt was sat on a camp chair on the deck outside his command shelter, gazing out at the tanith lines and the emerald glades of monthax beyond them. milo gave the data-slates to the commissar and then paused as he turned away, guilty as he realised what he had done. gaunt eyed the slates, scrolling the charts on the lit fascia of the top one. a guess. enough of your guesses. you know the trouble they might cause. for me. for you. for all the ghosts. but i won't make a soldier out of you. gaunt frowned. he hadn't realised. he flapped away a persistent fly and sipped his cup. he sat back down. thank you. a deal. gaunt turned back to find milo but the boy, probably on tin-basis of another wise anticipation, had made himself scarce. ten witch hunt varl lifted the tanith camo-cloak off the censer on the floor like a magician about to perform a conjuring trick. there was a hushed silence around the ship's hold as the veil came away. the game was simple and enticing and completely fixed, and sergeant varl and the boy mascot made a good team. they had a jar of fat, jumping lice scooped from the troop-ship's grain silos and that beaten old censer borrowed from the ecclesiarch chapel. the censer was a hollow ball of rusty metal whose hemispheres hinged open so that incense could be crumbled into the holder inside and lit. the ball's surface was dotted with star-shaped holes. he held it in his mechanical hand, and the servos hummed and whirred as he agitated the glass. varl was something of a showman, and milo liked him very much. he was one of what milo regarded as the inner circle of ghosts, a close friend of corbec and larkin, one of a gaggle of tight-knit friends and comrades mustered together from the militia of tanith magna at the founding.  varl's sharp tongue and speak-your-mind attitude had retarded his promotion chances early on, but then he had lost his arm on fortis binary during the heroic reconquest of the forge world and by the time of the now-legendary actions of menazoid epsilon he had been made a squad sergeant. many thought it was well past time. next to the ruthless command styles of rawne and feygor, and the intense military mindset of the likes of mkoll and the commissar himself, varl, like the beloved colonel corbec, injected a note of humanity and genial compassion into the ghosts' command structure. the men liked him: he told jokes as often as corbec, and they were for the most part funnier and cruder; his prosthetic arm proved he was not shy of close fighting; and he could, in his own, informal, garrulous way, spin a fine, inspiring speech to rouse his squad if the need called for it. just now though, in one of the troop-ship's echoing holds with an audience of off-duty guardsmen roused from their cots and stoves all around, he was turning his charismatic tongue to something far more important. see now, a metal ball, with surface holes. the grain-lice go in the ball� notice how i've scratched a number next to all the holes. thirty-three holes, a number next to each. no tricks, no guile varl took the rusty ball from milo and set it on the floor where all could see. that brought general laughter and keen sense of suffering comradeship. milo smiled. he loved the way varl could play a crowd. he wore his grey and gold twill breeches and black boots, but was stripped down to his undershirt. his body was a mass of wellnourished muscles and he stood two heads taller than varl. arrogance oozed from him. milo tensed. he knew that some rivalry existed between the ghosts and the bluebloods, ever since voltemand. no one had ever said, but the rumour was that the blueblood's own commanders, steering the invasion force, had ordered the barrage on the voltis riverbed where so many ghosts had died. this aristocratic giant, with his hooded eyes and bullying manner, had at least six friends in the crowd, and all were as big as him. what the feth do they feed them on back home to raise such giants? milo wondered. varl, unconcerned, got down off the crates he had been using as a stage and approached the giant. he held out his hand. major gilbear did not seem convinced. others in the crowd agreed, and not just bluebloods. varl said, as if it was breaking his heart. milo squeaked. raballe! varl gasped, dropping to his knees and wiping away what seemed to milo a real tear as he surveyed his crushed insects. a tidal change swept through the secondary betting, some of it in sympathy with the damaged ghost and his crushed pets, some sensing trickery was routed and heaping money on the blueblood major. gilbear smiled at his deduction and his men growled approval. so did several of the wily slammabadden, and milo was afraid the mood might turn ugly. the blueblood's second was returning with a jar packed full of agitated lice and semi-digested meal where he had scooped it from the dank silos. gilbear nodded. they made ready. the gamblers, milo included, prepared to make their guess on the paper slips provided. varl flexed his good shoulder, as if easing out an old hurt. a signal, the next guile. he seemed to sway and he stank of sacra. go away, little bluebloods. last thing i need. the roane are the very devil to keep in line. good fighters, yes, when they're roused to it, but damned idle for the most part. a few weeks of transportation confinement like this, and i'll have to kick each and every one of their arses to get them down the drop-ship ramp. languid, lazy � and this makes it worse : they're superstitious, more than any band of men i've ever known. he did. his old regiment, the hyrkans, were tough as deck plate, but there had been times when the thought of psyker madness had balked them in their tracks. volovoi asked. volovoi whistled. gaunt smiled, though it was dark. gaunt made to leave. crossing the orrery deck, he was afforded a better view of the volpone staff. gilbear was stood alone now, staring at gaunt with a burning look that did not flinch. sturm, escorted by his aides, was heading up the long flight of steps to the lord militant general's private chambers in the spire above. walking the troop decks with gaunt, corbec brought his commander up to speed. many look on intrusion and burglary in a similar way. identify yourself. gaunt lowered the pistol and set it down on the side-table. lilith moved forward into the room and gently kicked one of the troopers. gaunt stayed where he was and fixed his gaze on her. gaunt breathed deeply. lilith sighed and steepled her long, pale fingers. then she pointed the compact laspistol right at gaunt. he started, amazed. she had not moved, but now she held a gun which had been lying right across the room from her. how good a reason do i need? good. we'll begin. by the proclamation of the most high emperor, governed as i am by his will, in totality, till the end of all days, as a servant of the inquisition, i require you to furnish with me with answers of complete truth and veracity to your best knowledge. the penalties for deception are manifold and without limit. gaunt cleared his throat. the men like him. my own exit was barred and the boy intervened, clearing my way. in gratitude, i took him with me. lilith came close to gaunt and stared into his eyes. you can admit it. very good. very direct. so we can cut the crap, can we? i have notice that the boy is a witch. gaunt swallowed. lilith smiled. why? you were not a soldier. you are not a soldier now. milo glanced at gaunt briefly. gaunt froze. wrong answer, brin, wrong answer � milo seemed to tremble. she asked, almost eager. here it comes, thought gaunt. they're all soldiers. gaunt asked. open it. put the bug inside. now, milo. this isn't a game, is it? it's a scam. it's a trick the tanith use to win cash from the other guards. and if it's a scam, it needs a sting. it needs a foolproof method to make it a sure thing the tanith will win. you're the sting, aren't you? on demand, you can guess right� because that's what you do, isn't it? milo shook his head. if it's a game, why do you play it with unsuspecting troops from other regiments? by my own investigation, you and your friends have earned a small fortune from other men in these last few days. i say nine. milo tapped his head. lilith got up smartly, crushing the bug underfoot with a deliberate heel. it left a brown stain on one beak of the imperial crest. they walked back together through the hallways of the hexathedral. night cycle was coming to an end, and dawn prayers and offerings were being made in the echoing chapels and chambers around. well done. milo asked. gaunt stopped in his tracks. yes, i would. i would have had to. corbec asked. gaunt shrugged. it was a disarming gesture from one usually so confident. general thoth is sending us in, as soon as we're ready, on orders from lord militant general bulledin himself. the tanith will form one arm of a counter assault. upwards of sixty thousand men from various regiments are to be deployed against the enemy. because of the peculiar, not to say perplexing orientation of their advance, we'll catch them side on. the tanith aren't heavy troops. main force, without playing to our strengths? gaunt fixed the man with a tight stare. the briefing was over, save to agree platoon order and position. the officers filed out. gaunt stopped mkoll. just off centre in the middle of the area mapped out as the new front, gaunt saw what he was pointing to. a mark on the map representing the estimated position of the prehuman ruins mkoll had found while scouting just a few days before. gaunt began to strap on his holster belt. milo would have refused but for the look in gaunt's eyes. this was a trust thing, a subtle command responsibility. gaunt was entrusting him to watch the third from the inside. teygor hissed to milo as they crept through the weeds. milo nodded, biting back a curse. he knew he was moving more swiftly and silently than many in rawne's platoon. he knew too that he had fastened his webbing and applied his camo-paint better than any of them. colm corbec had taken time to teach him well. but he also knew he wasn't an outsider anymore, a boy piper, a mascot. he was a ghost, and as such he would obey the letter of his superiors. even if they were dangerous, treacherous men. with rawne's scout logris in the vanguard, the ten men filed through the glades and thickets of the monthax jungle. milo found himself behind caffran, the only trooper in the platoon who he liked. or trusted. rawne paused them in a basin of weed and silt-muck which stank of ripe vegetation while logris and teygor edged ahead. tiny flies swirled like dust over the soup. caffran, his face striped with camo-paint, turned to milo and gently adjusted the straps of the lad's weapon, like a big brother looking after a younger sibling. caffran whispered. caffran smiled. across the silky water, larkin watched them from his position curled into the root network of a mangrove. he knew that caffran and the piper boy had never been friends before now. he had heard caffran talk of it. though little more than two years separated them, caffran felt uneasy around the lad, because he reminded him too much of home. now that seemed to be forgotten and larkin was glad. it seemed having milo in his company had given caffran purpose. a novice, a little brother, someone junior to the youngest ghost that caffran could take care of. caffran felt it too. he no longer despised brin milo. trooper milo was one of them now. it was like� it was like they were back home. caffran couldn't understand why he had shunned the boy so. they were all in this together. all tanith, after all. and besides, if gaunt had seen fit to protect milo all this time, caffran was damned if anything would happen to the boy. rawne waited at the ditch edge for logris and teygor. his eyes were fierce diamonds of white with hard, dark centres, flashing from the band of camo-paint across his face. there was something terribly familiar about their situation. he could feel it in his marrow. soon there would be killing. spoonbills flapped by. i've spoken to him. he looked back at domor. under the shade of great, oil-sweet trees, corbec's platoon, the second, moved into the mire and the glades. the colonel missed larkin, but his squad already had the crack-shot merrt, so it would have been churlish to complain. feth, corbec was thinking, all this time driven mad by larks' babbling and scaremongering, and now i actually wish he was here. ahead, the glades widened into a lagoon. the still water was coated with russet weed, and black, rotten wood limbs and roots poked up out of it. corbec motioned the second on behind him, the thigh-deep water leaving a greasy film on his fatigues. he raised his gun higher. along the far end of the lagoon, corbec could see shapes: moving figures. merrt asked. gaunt ordered, urging the men of first forward through the shin-deep water along the glade bed. his chainsword was in his hand and purring. they could hear the close shooting, harsher and more immediate than the distant thunder of the mysterious war they were approaching: corbec's platoon, fighting and firing. but the source was unspecified, remote. gaunt damned the thickness and false echoes of the glades. why was this place so impossibly confused? las-fire spat across the glades at the first platoon. lowen fell, cut through and smouldering. raglon went down too, a glancing burn to his cheek. the enemy fire was too heavy to charge against. gaunt fell his platoon into cover and they began to return fire with drilled, careful precision. they loosed their las-rounds down the funnel of the glade, and the salvos that came back at them were loose and unfocused. gaunt could see the position of the enemy from their muzzle flashes. they were badly placed and poorly spaced. he ordered his men up, searching for a rousing command. no further than two hundred metres. a little further off. he's right. rawne could feel feygor's itching impatience. the waiting, the fething anticipation, was often harder than the fighting itself. his men fixed their own knives as bayonets in response. there was the sound of water, drizzling. the spitting noise almost blocked out the muffled fighting elsewhere. but not the distant heavy bombardment of the duelling armour. mkoll followed a lip of rocks, slick with black lichen, around the edge of a pool in deep shadow. a skein of water fell from a mossy outcrop thirty metres above, frothing the plunge pool. it was as humid and dark as a summer night in this dim place. mkoll heard movement, a skittering of rocks high above at the top of the falls. cover was scant, so without hesitation he slid off the lip of stone into the water, sinking down to his neck, his lasgun held up in one hand at ear level, just above the surface. with fluid precision, he glided under the shadow of the rock, moving behind the churning froth of the cataract. shadows moved along the top of the rock above him. fifteen, perhaps twenty warriors. he caught their scent: the spicy, foul reek of something barely human. he heard low, clipped voices crackle back and forth via helmet intercoms, speaking a language that he was thankful he could not understand. mkoll felt his guts vice involuntarily. it wasn't fear of the enemy, or of death; it was fear of what the enemy was. their nature. their abomination. the water seemed glass-cold around him. his limbs were deadening. but hot sweat leaked down his face. then they were gone. mkoll waited a full two minutes until he was sure. then he crawled up out of the water and padded off silently in the direction from which his enemy had come. seventh platoon came out of a deep grove into sudden sunlight and even more sudden gunfire. three of sergeant lerod's men were down before he had time to order form and counter. enemy fire stripped the trees all around, pulverising bark and foliage into sap mist and splinters. the enemy had at least two stub guns and a dozen lasweapons in cover on the far side of the narrow creek. lerod bellowed orders in the whistling flashes of the exchange, moving backwards and firing from the hip on auto. two of his men had made good cover and were returning hard. others fought for places with him. t'argin, the voxoperator, was hit twice in the back and fell sideways, his twitching corpse held upright, like a puppet, in a drapery of moss-creepers. a las-round stung lerod's thigh. he knelt helplessly, then dropped to his belly in desperation, blasting up into the trees. his wild fire hit something � a weapon power-pack, perhaps � and a seething sheet of flame rushed out of the far creek bank, stripping and felling trees and tossing out two blackened bodies which cartwheeled in the air and fell into the creek bed. pin-pointing lerod as the source of this little victory, the unseen stubbers traversed and sent stitching lines of firepower down the earth trail where he sprawled. he saw them in a split second: the twin lines of ferocious tracers etching their way across the loam to slice him into the ground. there was nothing he could do� no time. he closed his eyes. lerod opened them again. by some miracle, both lines of fire had missed him, passing either side of his prone form. he began to laugh at the craziness of it and rolled into the cover of trees a few metres to the left, exhorting his surviving company with renewed vigour to give back and give hard. he felt jubilant, like he had on the founding fields below tanith magna, before the toss. he had never thought he would have that feeling again. with bitter resentment, corbec pulled the second back from the lagoon where they were stymied. they were outgunned and partly circled. the tanith fell back, quickly and silently into the trees, leaving tripwires and tube rounds in their wake. gaunt nodded, directing his men forward a metre at a time trying to out-mark and topple the enemy possession of the fat-bank. explosions crackled through the trees in the direction of corbec's retreat as the advancing foe tripped the first of the mines. gaunt cursed. this terrain was meant to give the ghosts the advantage with their stealth skills, but the enemy was everywhere, as if milling and confused.  and though that meant they were not working to a cohesive plan, it also meant the larger enemy force was splintered, unpredictable and all around them. raglon was firing from cover and gaunt ducked in behind him, waving corbec over. corbec sprinted across the open ground, his tunic and face splattered with pulverised leaf flecks and sap. he looked like the old man of the woods in the traditional least of leaves, back home on tanith, whe� gaunt froze, startled and confused. back home on tanith! what tricks was his mind playing now? he'd never heard of any feast of the leaves, yet it had seemed to bob up from his memory as a truth. for a moment, he could even smell the sugared nal-fruit as they roasted in their charcoal ovens. then he tapped his clearance into the small board of rune-marked keys, and main battle-data began to display on his slate, direct from general thoth's leviathan command base. gaunt selected an overall tactical view so he and corbec could take in the state of the battle. the tanith were shown as a thin, vulnerable line, static and held along the main watercourse. to either side of them, heavier regiments and armoured units were making greater headway, but these too were slow and foundering. the volpone were pushing from the east, with massive artillery support, but the trynai sixth and sixteenth were pinned down and slowly being slaughtered. he wound the dial to bring up a specific display of the ghosts' struggling advance. all of the platoons were essentially halted and most engaged in heavy fire. lerod's unit was taking the brunt of it. rawne's, gaunt noticed, had so far failed to engage. gaunt said aloud. the third edged on, passing a deep hidden pool with a glittering waterfall that fell from a crop of mossy rock. rawne split his platoon and moved them up either side of the water. feygor stooped to pick up something and showed it to the major. it was a cell from a lasgun, but not imperial issue. rawne cursed. mud? filthy water? milo rubbed his own nose, as if he distrusted it. caffran was about to laugh, but then realised that he smelled it too. it was astonishing, almost overwhelming in its nostalgia. the air indeed smelt of the rich conifers of tanith. now he thought about it, the trees and foliage around them seemed darker, much more like the wet-land forests of his lost home-world. nothing like the stinking, seething jungle they had known since arriving on monthax. milo nodded. it was crazy � and scary too. from the cover of some low, flowering bushes, busy with insects, mkoll could see a clearing ahead. there had been brief, heavy fighting there not more than two hours before. the earth was churned up, trees burned back and splintered. bodies smouldered on the ground. he crept forward to look. the dead were chaos soldiery heavily armed and armoured in quilted red fatigues and bare steel armoured sections. their helmets were inscribed with such horrific symbols and figures he began to dryheave until he looked away. others had fallen here too, but their bodies had been removed. no imperial unit had got this far in. there was another force at play on monthax. mkoll looked at the wounds on the fallen. here and there, a helmet or metal breast-plate had been punctured, not by an energy round or explosive shell, but by something sharp and clean which had punched right through composite metal. in a tree stump behind one corpse, mkoll found a missile embedded, a wickedly sharp metal star with razor-edged points. with a long, slow sigh that wheezed out of his helmet's mouthpiece, the old one sat back on the stone seat at the centre of the inner place. like a spider at the heart of a complex web, he reached out mentally and tested the strands of his net of deceit, the cloak of confusion he had spread out around him, leagues in every direction. it was serving its purpose for now. he studied the minds caught in his net: so very many of them cruel and brutish and overflowing with the poison of chaos. and the others, the brief human sparks. the imperials had engaged too, he realised, coming in to try their strength against the forces of chaos as they moved. he saw bloody fighting. he saw primitive courage. humans always surprised him that way. such little life-spans, so furiously exhausted. their valour would be almost admirable if it wasn't so futile. yet perhaps he could use that. to make allies was out of the question, but he could use all the time he could buy, and these determined imperial humans, with their relentless urge to fight and win, could help him in that. it was past time for him to play his last hand. he would work the humans, for what little good they could do, into that gambit. a final check now. muon nol, dire avenger, master of the bodyguard, entered the inner place at the old one's mental summons. he held his great white-crested helm under one arm, the red plume crest perfect and trim, and his opalescent blue armour glittered with flecks of gold, like the heart of a cooling star. the braided tassels of his cape hung down to his waist, shrouding the weapons cinched tight to his back. his noble, ancient eyes studied the old one. muon nol looked down at the smooth stone floor where the shimmer of his blue armoured form was reflected. the old one held up his hand, the one that was bare of a glove. the sight of those ancient fingers, almost translucent with wasting age, silenced muon nol's protests. muon muon nol raised his head. were those tears in his dark eyes? eon kull, the old one, lifted his weapon from the rim of the stone seat. the dim light shone from the long, smooth barrel of the buanna, and twinkled on the inlay at the grip and shoulder guard, uliowye, the kiss of sharp stars. the weapon of a champion, precious and celebrated. muon nol took the old shrieker cannon reverently. gaunt screamed into the rain. no one had an answer. witchery, they all thought. typhoon-force winds surged in along the edges of the storm. imperial air-cover was pulled out and grounded, but not before two marauders had been torn out of the air and smashed. one, its stabilisers gone and its thrusters screaming, managed to turn its death into a pyrrhic victory by taking out a line of chaos tanks gummed down in a clearing which had abruptly become a lake. the vast, multiple explosions were lost in the roar of the storm. caught in a sudden flash flood, stunned by the force of the hail and rain, mkoll clung on to a nearly uprooted mangrove to stop himself being carried off.  blinking water from his eyes , he saw his lasgun ride away in the leafchoked froth. he felt the loss acutely. he had been so careful and protective of that simple, standard-issue gun. there was none better kept, better cared for, or cleaner in the tanith regiment. now it spun away from him, ruined, swamped. but he had his life still � for as long as the roots would hold. rawne pushed third platoon forward through the deluge. their hair and uniforms were plastered to their pale skins. some edifice rose ahead, a structure of stone raised from fashioned blocks. to rawne, it seemed almost familiar. his urgent commands were lost in the hurricane winds. a snapped off branch whickered through the gale and the near-horizontal downpour and struck trooper logris in the throat. milo tried to help him but it was too late. his neck was broken and his head lolled around the wrong way. already, his crumpled body was being sucked down into the swelling mud by the hideous rain. caffran grabbed milo and dragged him through the storm of wind and rain and flurrying leaves into the cover of the stone ruin. rawne yanked them in to join the other members of his platoon: feygor, cown, wheln, mkendrik, larkin, cheffers. but cheffers was dead. there was no sign of injury on him until cown spotted the blood oozing from a slit in his throat. something protruded from it. it was a leaf. carried point-first by the stabbing wind, the stiff leaf had punctured cheffers' throat and cut his windpipe. horrified, with the wind and rain wailing against the stone block at their backs, they saw how their tunics and cloaks had been torn and sliced by other such leaf-missiles. rawne didn't know. everything had been going smoothly until then. the mustering on the founding fields. the preparation for disembarkment. and now a storm like nothing he'd seen before had fallen on tanith magna. every one of them responded, checking their lasguns. except milo. milo blinked. the roar of the storm just outside the stone blocks sheltering them seemed to have left him concussed. rawne and the others had gone mad. this wasn't tanith! they were acting like it was the homeworld and � he stopped. the stone wall in front of him was a solid section of tanith basalt, mined from the quarries at pryze junction. the crest of the elector was inscribed into it. he knew this place� a side corridor just off the main western fortification of the capital city. but� for a moment, milo faltered. he could remember something. a dying world, a small brotherhood of survivors� ghosts� playing the pipes to urge them on. just a dream. just a bad dream, he realised. they were mustering at the foundation of the tanith regiments and chaos had attacked their homeworld. they had no choice. stand and fight, or die. and if they died, tanith would die with them. the storm, a spinning electrical disk of clouded black fury sixty kilometres in diameter, held its position unerringly above the battle front. its power and force were so great, even the mighty cogitators of the hexathedral sanctity, high in orbit, couldn't compute its magnitude or penetrate the dome of blistering interference it created. any imperial forces that still had a measure of mobility, those that had not been swept away or mired, began to pull back to their lines, making what headway they could in the appalling conditions. many units, most of them armour and heavy fighting vehicles, were cut off or swamped, helpless and detached from the main retreat. no one, not even general thoth's chief tacticians, could begin to guess the state, response or position of the foe they were meant to be engaging. had they broken too? were they just as lost, or had all of them been obliterated by the hurricane? or was this their doing? many of the imperial veterans and officers had seen psychic storms before, a favoured terror-weapon of the chaotic foe. but this was not the same. there was no pestilential quality to it, no reek of unholy filth, no heaviness in the air that made skin crawl and bowels churn and minds spin into waking nightmares. just titanic fury. almost pure, elemental power. a null. yet, if they could read it, the warp was there. the unmistakable flavour of the warp. inquisitor lilith had no doubts at all. her attuned senses had no trouble in detecting the cold psyker power galvanising the deluge. indeed, it was all she could do to shut it out and stop it howling and screaming through her mind. the rumours of pysker-witchery said to haunt this world were true, but this witchery had a power and clarity like none she had ever felt. she strode through the downpour in a long cape of dripping black leather, her cowl pulled up. she stared fixedly at the storm which boiled in the sky two leagues or so from her position. her honour guard escort marched in her train. she could feel their nervousness and unwillingness to proceed into an area all other right-minded guard units were fleeing from. but lord militant general bulledin had appointed them to serve lilith as she prosecuted this event, and they feared the lord militant and the inquisitor more than any storm. the escort was thirty troopers from the royal volpone 50th, the bluebloods. they wore the grey and gold body armour and low-brimmed bowl helmets of the volpone, with wet-weather oilskins draped lankly over their torsos. their shoulders and arms were massive with segmented carapace armour, and they were each armed with a mattblack hellgun fresh from the weapon shops of leipaldo. each man had a bright indigo imperial eagle stud pinned into his armaplas collar section, marking them all as from the volpone tenth brigade, the elite veteran force. only the best of the best for an imperial inquisitor. with them came a shrouded astropath, one of lilith's own staff. he jerked and staggered at every twitch of the storm, and was given a wide berth by the volpone soldiers. the detail commander, major gilbear, fell in step with the inquisitor. his face was set grimly, but he projected a sickening sense of pompous pride at taking this duty. gilbear asked, using the formal aristocratic dialect of the highest imperial courts. it was partly to impress her, lilith knew, and partly to establish his own selfimportance. the huge volpone clearly wanted to show he believed himself to be more than a common soldier. as if they were� equals� an insult, she knew, but one that might make him quit his airs and graces. she hadn't time to be bothered with him right now. he nodded curtly, and she smiled at the throb of bitten-down anger he radiated. they crossed a foaming waterbed, shallow, but fast running, where a dozen chimeras of the roane deepers were struggling to dig themselves out.  agitated, spooked troopers milled around, shouting, cursing and heaving on stripped tree trunks to lever out clogged track units. tine drizzle from the edge of the storm whipped across them, creating a billion impact ripples in the water. on the far side, the inquisitor's party followed the bank in towards the edge of the storm. there was debris in the spraying water here: shreds of equipment, helmets, pieces of foliage, drowned bodies, all swirling downstream in the flood. inquisitor lilith called a halt in a clearing where vast deciduous trees had been reduced to blackened columns by lightning strikes. a raft of wood pulp and leaves sloshed and ebbed over the swamped ground. she pulled out her data-slate and reviewed it. it showed the positions of all the imperial forces, each individual unit, as last recorded before the storm came down. a complex data-mosaic of thousands of individual components, one that would take a trained tactician hours to assess. but she had already located the one element which interested her: the third platoon of the first-and-only tanith. mkoll made it to higher ground, the rain and wind pelting him. the sky was black, and it was as dark as night, but his night-vision couldn't adjust because of the frequent blinding flashes of lightning which strobed across him. he was all but deaf with the near-constant thunder. in places, mud-slides had brought parts of the high ground slope down, and more than once he was almost carried off his feet as thick, slimy folds of mud came loose and oozed away down the incline. he glimpsed something in the next lightning flash that made him stop in his tracks, and he wailed for the next searing discharge to confirm what he had seen. the ruin. the ruin he had glimpsed on patrol before and had spent so long trying to find once more. he wouldn't lose it again. mkoll stayed put and waited through the next three or four flashes, memorising the elements of the landscape, both near and far, as it was revealed to him in split-second snapshots. in the last flash, he saw the movement too. enemy warriors, higher up the slope, stumbling across him in the deluge by chance. as the world went black again, they fired his way, cracking red lines in the darkness and the rain. mkoll slid down onto his knees in the mud, trying to use the slope to give him as much cover as possible against the killers moving down the hill from above. another flash. they were closer. six or more, most holding their weapons one-handed as they clung onto sagging saplings and outcrops of rock to keep themselves upright as they came down the incline. in the darkness, more red fire-bolts. mkoll pulled out his laspistol. he was blind, but the red flashes were a focus in the dark. he waited for more shots, then fired directly at the source of the blasts. then he scrambled to his left so they couldn't use the same trick on him. his precaution was wise. the muddy ridge which had previously sheltered him was hit by four separate bursts of enemy fire. boiled mud spattered up in lazy splashes. the tumultuous rain washed the steam away immediately. more lightning. this brief gift of sight revealed to mkoll the huge shape of a chaos soldier almost on top of him. he'd either been trying to flank mkoll's last position or been brought down the slick, treacherous slope faster than intended they had almost collided. mkoll swung up his laspistol and shot him through the chest, point blank, before he could react. the enemy, a stinking dead-weight draped in loose chains and angular, rusty armour plates, slammed into mkoll and flattened him back into the ooze. locked under the corpse, mkoll began to slide back down the mud-slope. he fought to get out from under the body and freed himself. now he and the corpse slid down the hill more gently, head first, on their backs, side to side. mkoll swung over onto his knees, slipping down again twice before he properly righted himself. he was coated with mud and slime, though the slap of the rain washed it out of his eyes. he felt it had poured thickly into his ears too, because he was truly deaf now. or had the detonations of the thunder finally burst his eardrums? gunfire chased his way, hunting his last shot. he could see the red rips in the rain, but they were silent now. there was nothing but a low, constant grumble in his ears. he got down next to the corpse. there was no sign of its main weapon, but an antique laspistol was hooked into its waistband. he pulled it out. it was longer, heavier and far more ornate than his simple, standard-pattern guard pistol. the pear-shaped hand-grip was wrapped in fine chain and leather cord, and grotesque symbols were inlayed along the under-barrel furniture in pearl and silver. a yellow dot of light showed it was fully charged. blue light, harsh and electrical, shone over him. phosphor flares, two first, then a third, trembled up into the sheeting rain over the hillside. mkoll's eyes adjusted to the bright, flickering twilight. he could see the trees in stark black relief, the solid, blurring veil of the rain. he could see the enemy, nine or more, scrambling down the bank onto him, the closest twenty metres away. and they could see him. they opened fire. it was silent still, just that rumble like grinding teeth, but plumes of mud burst up from impacts around him, and scythed through the bole of a tree to his left, bringing the fifty metre tall trunk crashing down. mkoll slid under it where the ground dipped, pulling himself through a gully full of rushing water. emerging on the other side, with the fallen trunk as cover, he found sound had returned. the water had sluiced the sticky mud from his ears and the sides of his head. noise rushed in at him: the thunder, the crack of shots, the clamouring voices like a baying pack of hounds. digging his heels into the soft ground for purchase, he swung up and leaned across the tree trunk, firing a pistol in each hand. the laser bolts from his regular gun were stark and white. those from the captured weapon were dirty and red. he shot at the two attackers closest to him and dropped them straight off. one fell twisted, into a tangle of foliage. the other slid on his nose, spread-eagled, right down the slope and disappeared into the rushing water of the creek bed below. mkoll ducked down and crept along the length of the fallen trunk as return fire cremated and split the section he had been using for cover. digging his feet in again, he popped up once more, and shot another enemy through the side of the head. two more were close on him, but a thick brake of trees baffled his aim. shots tore at him. he blasted with his twin guns again, exploding the shoulder of an attacker flanking him to the left. a las-round exploded the trunk in front of him and he reeled back into shelter, sucking at the new splinters of wood slivered into his forearms and fingers. mkoll fought away the sharp, superficial pain. he began to crawl along under the block of the tree trunk again, but back towards his original position of cover to wrong-foot them. the next time he rose to bring his weapons to bear, three of the enemy soldiers had reached his last position and were clambering over the fallen log to blast down into the gully beyond. firing down the length of the tree, mkoll killed them all before they realised they were shooting at nothing.  one toppled back and slid under the trunk, another fell across it and dropped into thick mud that sucked his corpse half-under. the third fell draped across the log. the flares were dying and the strobe lighting of the storm was beginning to reassert itself. mkoll saw that dozens more of the enemy were advancing down the slope from above, and there were still four or five in his immediate field of fire. he was running out of chances and options. he began to run, back down the length of the fallen log, then across the contour of the hill towards the ruin in the incline beyond shots chased him. he fell once � and it saved his life, as las-rounds cut the air that had, just a second before, been occupied by his head. he rolled down the bank, only partly voluntarily, then scrambled up again and ran on. more flares lit the sky. silver light kissed the ground, the muddy slope and the curtain of rain. the trees became black fingers with multiple shadows. two enemy soldiers charged at him out of the spray, head on one fired, his shots going wild. mkoll's guns were still in his hands and he shot each one in the head as he ran between them. behind the dead, three more. one managed to react fast enough to pull his trigger and mkoll felt his neck recoil as something painfully hard and hot stung across his scalp. blood streamed down his face. he wondered if he had been shot in the head, if his thoughts and motions were simply a nervous reaction carrying him forward past the point of death, his brain cooked backwards out of the exploded cup of his skull. whatever the truth, he wasn't going to stop. he shot the foe who had hit him with both pistols, then leapt the corpse, extending his guns out on either side to target the other pair. the leap was brave but foolish. treacly mud took his feet away as he landed and his shots went wild. tracking him as he leapt between them, the two soldiers of chaos fired simultaneously and killed each other. mkoll struggled up, laughing out loud at this little piece of imperial justice. then he stopped and holstered one of his guns, feeling his scalp with his freed hand. he fully expected to find a jagged edge of skull like a broken egg, but there was a just bloody gouge across the top of his head, and a section of his hair was crisped away. his cap had vanished. it had been a glancing wound. no doubt rawne would have remarked upon the obstinate solidity of his skull. he stumbled on towards the rise, needles of red light sweeping his trail. outnumbered and outgunned, he realised it was time for the most drastic action. mkoll reached a tough-looking stump and lashed himself to it with his webbing. he took three tube-charges out of his thigh pouch, wound them tightly in a bunch with tape and hurled them back up the slope behind him. lightning broke at the same second the charges went off, washing out the flash and the roar. then the entire hillface squealed and fell away, a vast mud-slide that brought thousands of tonnes of liquid mud, rock and plants down, sweeping the enemy away with it into a soft tomb at the creek bed. waves of mud and liquid filth smashed into mkoll; timbers carried down from higher up slammed into him. he choked and vomited on the fluid rush. then it was over. the storm blitzed on and the air was reeking with the pungent smell of freshly exposed soil. mkoll was hanging from the tree stump by his webbing. the slide had washed away his footing and carried off several metres of top-soil, but the stump's deep roots had been more firmly bedded. it was one of the few things still standing proud of the smooth, sagging, crescent-shaped mud-slip. mkoll pulled off his webbing and dropped free. nearby, the clawing hand of a buried foe warrior jerked and clawed up from the thick mud. mkoll fired into the mud until the hand stopped twitching. he made it to the next rise and looked down into the deep jungle cavity where the ruin sat, solemn and mysterious on a high mound. the second volley of flares were dying away now, but he knew what he saw. the ruin was besieged by chaos. hundreds of thousands of enemy warriors, glistening and churning like beetles in the downpour, assaulted the great ruin from all sides. they were relentless, ignoring the storm as if all that mattered was the jagged crown of stones at the top of the mound. mkoll breathed aloud. the sky spasmed above them, stricken with electrical convulsions, first platoon, with the remnants of corbec's unit and the stragglers of lerod's who had joined them by accident in the storm's chaos, struggled on as they beat the retreat. gaunt came upon corbec, who was clambering in the lead through the rain and the undergrowth. trooper melk was now on a stretcher carried in the rear of the retreat. gaunt shouted. the explosion cut the tree above the root and dropped its sixty metre mass across the boiling tide: a bridge of sorts. one by one, the men crawled across. corbec led them to prove it could be done, cursing as each handhold slipped and tore away from the sodden bark. trooper vowl lost his grip and dropped from the horizontal log. the flash-flood carried him away like a cork. a screaming cork. on the far side, corbec saw to the defence of the position, ordering each drenched man fresh from the crossing into place, lasgun aimed, creating a wide dispersal of ready soldiers in a fan to protect those still crossing the timber bridge. corbec moved forward himself, into the horsetail ferns and hyacinths, their fronded leaves lashed and shaken by the drumming rain. there was movement ahead. he reported it via his micro-bead but got nothing back. the storm was playing merry hell with the vox-links. clammy, cold hands tightening on his lasgun, corbec inched forward. a hellgun fired to his right, wide, a piercing distinctive report. he started forward and fell into the grip of three large figures which slammed into him out of the pulsing darkness. he lost his lasgun. a fist hit him in the back of the neck and he dropped, then recovered and punched out. one of his assailants went down in the mud. another kicked at him and corbec kicked back, breaking something crucial. he was wrestling with the biggest of his opponents now, blind in the rain and the mud spray. corbec got a glimpse of gold and grey carapace armour, an imperial eagle stud of precious blue. underneath his rolling foe, he punched upwards into what should have been the face twice and then rolled his stunned aggressor over so that he was straddling him. a flash of lightning. corbec saw he was astride a volpone blueblood, a big man with a battered, bloodied face. a major. corbec had his hands around the man's throat. hellgun muzzles were suddenly pressing to his head. the major underneath him groaned venomously, trying to rise.  corbec raised his hands in a gesture of surrender, wary of the guns around him. gaunt stepped into the clearing, his bolt pistol aimed squarely at major gilbear's cranium. his gun was unfaltering. gaunt's voice was low and threatening. more ghosts moved in around the commissar, guns aimed. and you, commissar. gaunt lowered his bolt pistol. gilbear held his hand down to corbec and pulled him to his feet. their eyes locked as gilbear brought him up. how can you be sure? rawne stared down from a slit window in the thick stonework, night rain and high winds lashing the outside. there were fires outside, but no longer the reassuring lines of cook fires on the founding fields. the sky had fallen. doom had come to tanith. if there had been any doubt, rawne had seen warning flares rise and fall above the tree line not three minutes past. rawne clutched his freshly-issued lasgun to his chest. at least he would get to use it before he died. trooper caffran asked. rawne bit back the urge to yell at him. the boy was a novice, first taste of battle. brin milo's head was spinning. it all seemed so unreal, but he cautioned himself that was just shock at the speed of events. it had been stressful enough to prepare to leave tanith for ever. all the men had been edgy these last few days. now� this nightmare. that was what it was like. a nightmare. a twisting of reality where some things seemed blurred and others bright and over-sharp. there was no time to settle his nerves or soothe it away gunfire and a gout of flame rushed down the stone hallway from behind them. eon kull, the old one, awoke with a start. he cried out, an animal bark of pain. he found himself lying on the polished stone floor of the inner place. for a moment, he did not remember who or what he was. then it trickled back, like sand through the waist of an hourpiece, a grain at a time. he had lost consciousness and lain here, undiscovered, in his delirium. he could barely rise. his hands trembled; his limbs were as weak as a fildassai. blood was clotting in his mouth and nose. he felt his beating organs and pumping lungs rustle and wheeze inside his ribs like dying birds in a cage. he had to take stock. had he been successful? the spirit stones had all gone dark. fuehain talchior sat silent and still in her rack. the rune slivers were scattered across the floor as if someone had kicked over the arrangement. some glowed red hot and smouldered like iron in a smelter. others were wisps of curled ash. eon kull warlock gasped at the sight. he clawed at the runes, gathering up the fragments and the ash, burning his fingers. in the name of vaul the smithy-god, what had he wrought this day? what had he done? attempted too much, that was certain his age and his frailty had failed him, made him pass out and lose control, but surely for only a second or two. what had he unleashed? sacred asuryan, what had he done? his exhausted mind sensed muon nol returning to the inner place. the warrior should not, would not see him like this, eon kull found strength from somewhere and hauled himself back into his throne, clasping the purse of ash and bone-cinders to his belt. the way must be closed now. muon nol knelt on both knees and made the formal gesture of petition. he was glad muon eon kull leaned forward and touched muon nol's brow with his bared hand, sending a hesitant mental pulse that conveyed the unnumbered measure of the foe-host as he had sensed it. muon nol stiffened and shuddered. but he had no strength. had he expended so much? what had muon nol meant when he remarked upon his storm? shuffling, unsteady, eon kull crossed the inner place and opened the lid of a quartz box set against the wall. it was full of charred dust and some empty silk bags. a rare few still held objects and he took one out now. the wraithbone wand slipped out of its protective bag into his hand. it was warm, pulsing; one of the last he had left. he shuffled back to the throne, sank onto the seat with a sigh and clutched the wand to his chest. he prayed that there was strength enough in it to channel and focus his dissipated powers. the embers of his power lit through the wand, and the spirit stones around him and set into his armour blinked back into a semblance of life. most of them, at least. some remained dull and dead. many merely flickered with a dull luminosity. his mind blinked, two or three times, flashing images of the outside which roared and wailed. then it coalesced and he saw. he saw the storm, the magnitude of the storm. he cursed himself. he should have realised that he had been too weak to control such a conjuration. he had intended a storm, of course, as a diversion to cover his more subtle, complex illusions. but the stress had robbed him of consciousness, and he had lost control. he had unleashed a warp-storm, a catastrophic force that now raged entirely beyond his ability to command, far from covering the humans and allow them in close enough for the illusions to work them to his cause, he had all but blasted them away. his head lolled back. his final deed had been a failure. he had exhausted his entire power, burned his runes, extinguished some of his guide spirits, and all for this. kaela mensha khaine! an elemental force of destruction that fell, unselective, upon all. it roared about him, like a war-hound he had spent months training, only to see it go feral. there were a few faint spats of light, the traces of a handful of humans who had been close enough to become wrapped in his illusions. but far from enough. lord eon kull, old one, warlock, wept. he had tried. and he had failed. mkoll had been stumbling through the torrential rain for fifteen or more minutes before he stopped dead in his tracks, shook himself in amazement, and then hurled himself into the cover of a dripping, exposed tree-root. it was not possible. it was� some kind of madness. he look up at the stormy sky, shuddered and hugged himself. all along, he had suspected the storm was not natural in origin. now he knew it was playing with his mind. this was monthax, monthax, he told himself, over and over. not tanith. then why had he spent the last twenty minutes making his way home to the farmstead he shared with his wife and sons in the nal-groves above heban? shock pounded in his veins. it was like losing eiloni all over again, though he knew she was dead of canth-fever these last ten, fifteen years. it was like losing tanith again, losing his sons. he had been so convinced he was hurrying back through a summer storm from the high-pasturing cuchlain herds, so convinced he had a wife and a farm and a family and a livelihood to return to. but in fact he had been scrambling his way back towards the ruin and the massed forces of the enemy. how had his mind been so robbed of truth? what witchcraft was at work? he pulled himself to his feet and made off again, now in the opposite direction, towards what he prayed were friendly lines. on lilith's orders, a sizable force of men began pushing back into the storm-choked jungles. her bodyguard formed around her, following a roughly equal number of tanith ghosts under gaunt, the regrouped remnants of the first, second and seventh platoons. the wounded had been sent on to the lines. gilbear had protested, both at the advance and the co-operation of the tanith, but lilith had made no great efforts to disguise her contempt for him when she denied his objections. if her fears were realised, this was gaunt's business as much as hers. besides, the ghosts had already been in there, and had a taste of what to expect, for all the vaunted veteran skills of the volpone's elite tenth brigade, she wanted a serious fighting force, with enough numbers that losses wouldn't dent. sixty men, or thereabouts, half dedicated heavy infantry, ordered to guard her by the general, half the best stealth fighters in the guard, led by their own charismatic commissar. a reasonable insurgency force, she reckoned. still, she had had her astropath signal back for reinforcements. thoth had been reluctant until she had pulled rank and suggested the magnitude of the threat. now five hundred bluebloods under marshal ruas and three hundred roane deepers under major alef and commissar jaharn were moving up in their wake, an hour or so behind them. the astropath was now dead from the effort of sending and receiving through the storm. they left his body where it lay. it seemed bloody-minded to push a unit back into the storm zone when all other imperials had retreated out of it, and it seemed to compound that error by sending in fresh numbers after them. but lilith knew that, storm or no storm, chaos host or no chaos host, the key to victory on monthax lay in the heart of that zone. and the focus of her own, personal inquisition too, perhaps. lerod led the spearhead, lie had volunteered, brimming with an enthusiasm that gaunt found faintly alarming. yael, one of lerod's men from the seventh, had told of lerod's miraculous escape from the enemy gunners on the creek bank, and explained that lerod now thought his life charmed. gaunt wondered for a moment. he'd seen that sort of luck-flare before, where a man thought himself invulnerable. the consequences could be appalling. besides, lerod was a fine soldier. one of the best, the most level-headed. and more than that� all of the ghosts, corbec included, seemed somehow eager to get back into the deadly storm. it was as if something called to them. gaunt had seldom seen them so highly motivated.  and then, in a pause, he realised that he, too, was more than willing to turn back into the fatal onslaught besetting the dense jungle and creeks. he couldn't account for it. it alarmed him. lilith's brigade slogged in through the creek-ways and water-runs, beaten by the rain and wind. the muddy ground became steep slopes, the low rises of upland rain forests above the flooded swamps. lilith sent pairs of men forward to secure lines. corbec and a couple of ghosts and bluebloods clambered forward with lerod up the muddy escarpments, playing out cables that they secured to trees and stumps along the way. lightning berated them, exploding the tallest trees round about. the brigade moved forward, following the twin lines of cable the advance had played out. high on a slope, corbec nailed the end of his cable line to a stump, and then set watch with his party as the main force struggled up behind. corbec slapped the younger man on the armoured shoulder, and the other bluebloods eyed this camaraderie with suspicion. corbec guffawed. the young man grinned. culcis chuckled. the twin lines of advance progressed slowly up the slopes along the cable lines, weaving between the heavy trees and saturated foliage. the ground was like watered honey, loose and fluid, coming up to their shins. at least there were no insects abroad in the onslaught. they moved on in fire-team formation, following a deep valley into the jungle uplands and the heart of the roiling storm. lilith called a halt, to get a fix on their position. she was just raising her data-slate when a searing light flashed and they were deafened. lightning had struck a tree twenty paces back, exploding it in a welter of wooden shrapnel. two bluebloods had been atomised by electrical arcs and another two, along with one of the tanith, had been flayed alive by the wood chips. major gilbear slammed into lilith as he stumbled up the slope. gaunt was by her side. they compared data, pelting rain pattering off the screens of their respective devices. but if we move much further in, i'm not sure we'll be able to find our way back commissar! gilbear barked, snatching the headset from gaunt and adjusting the dials on raglon's caster set. gaunt signals, sir! he says to withdraw and pull out. give me that! sir? he focussed his mind on reality and shut up the yearnings in his head. home, the lines� he would make it� las-shots scorched at his heels, exploding trees. he glanced backwards and began to run. an enemy warrior loomed ahead of him and mkoll blasted with one of his pistols, taking the head clean off. all around him, in the rain, chaos warriors were closing. he ducked into cover as laser blasts puffed up leaf-mould and weed. two shots to the left. two to the right. a hit, and body falling and twisting in the grime. then mkoll was up and running again. a shot clipped his head and he went down, full length, into the mud. he tried to rise, but his body was slow and dazed. the mud sucked at him. a powerful hand took him by the shoulder and yanked him over, the mud sucking as it kissed him goodbye. mkoll looked up into the face of death, the raddled face of an enemy trooper. he shot him point blank and then rose, cutting the knees off the next foe who advanced with a double spit of las-fire from his guns. mkoll started shooting wholesale, picking off shadows that loomed between the trees through the storm, and fired on him. another shot kissed his flank and burned a scar that would never leave him. mkoll dropped to one knee, firing with both pistols. he killed left and right. maximum firepower. then he realised his captured laspistol was coughing inert gas. he threw it aside. as he went to reload his issue pistol, a huge form barrelled into him and knocked him down. the chaos trooper had his bayonet raised to rip mkoll's life out of his body. they wrestled in the mud for a few moments, until mkoll was able to use his trained skill to roll the other off him.  the sprawling warrior threw his bayonet and it impaled mkoll's left knee with a clack of metal on bone and a ripping of tendons. mkoll faltered and fell. the enemy was back on him, hands outstretched and a murderous howl on his sutured lips. they fell back, thrashing, fighting. mkoll couldn't reach the tanith blade in his waistband, but he found the enemy bayonet sticking out of his knee and wrenched it free. cursing his life and mourning eiloni, mkoll plunged the dagger two, three, four times into the side of his aggressor's neck, until the bestial warrior shuddered and died. mkoll pulled himself free of the corpse, blood jetting from his knee with a force too great for the downpour to diminish. he stumbled on, armed only with the enemy knife now. he was getting weaker as he lost blood. he foot of his wounded leg was hot with blood, yet cool. his knee didn't work properly. more fire came his way, cutting the limbs of trees and bursting ripe fruit-flowers. a deflecting laser round took him in the small of the back, and dropped him, face down, in the mire. stunned, he writhed, no breath coming, mud sucking into his nose and mouth. something made him pull himself up. something, some urge. eiloni. she stood over him, as pale and as beautiful as she had been at twenty. major gilbear. gilbear swung around and made off to check the pickets. corbec poked his tongue out at the major's back and made a vulgar noise. gaunt was about to reprimand him when he saw lilith was laughing. yes, but� yes. corbec is the soundest officer i've ever worked with. gaunt paused and looked off into the night where corbec had vanished. mkoll's the best i have, all in all. she stared into his eyes and another smile lit her pale face. gaunt wondered if this was another of her guiles, but it seemed genuine. gaunt was about to pick her up on it when she shivered, pushing back her cowl and running a hand through her fine hair. gaunt stepped towards her, ushering her towards mkoll. now gaunt grinned. gaunt suddenly became aware of how long he had been looking into her eyes. he broke the gaze. let us. one of the men protested and gilbear kicked him again. in the face, the ribs, the kidneys as he went down. he kept kicking. the other ghost had risen to defend his fallen, balled-up comrade, and gilbear turned on him, punching him out, then laying in with the boot. a big hand caught the blueblood major by the shoulder. he dropped gilbear with a headbutt that split the blueblood's forehead. then corbec whaled in with two hard punches to the mouth and chest. the latter was deflected by the carapace segments. gilbear sprawled in the mud, pulling corbec down on him in a threshing frenzy. he growled. gilbear folded his legs up and propelled corbec headlong over him with a kick. the big ghost slammed down against a tree stump, upside down, the sharp stump-ends raking his back. now gilbear was on his feet, fists balled. corbec leapt up to meet him, throwing off his cape, fury in his eyes. they edged around the muddy clearing in the slanting rain, water washing off them and sluicing the blood from their wounds. punch and counter-punch, followed by bellow and charge. the two beaten ghosts were up on their feet, cheering and jeering. others, ghosts and bluebloods both, congregated in a ring as the two officers battled by lightning flash. gilbear was a boxer, a heavyweight champion back on volpone, with a stinging right hook and a terrifying capacity to take punishment. corbec was a wrestler, pryze county victor three years running, at the logging show. gilbear bounced on spread legs, throwing humiliating punches. corbec came in low, soaking them up, clawing his hands around gilbear's throat. with a roar, corbec drove in under the whistling fists and slammed gilbear backwards through a break of trees. they tumbled together down a short incline into a creek bed swollen with storm water. the ghost and volpone audience hovered at the rim of the creek, looking down and chanting. gilbear rose first, black with the muddy water, and swung a punch. it kissed air. corbec exploded up out of the flood, greased jet-black with liquid mud, and doubled gilbear with a low punch to the gut, then sent him over in a spray of silver droplets with an upper cut to the chin. gilbear wasn't done. he came back out of the water like a surfacing whale, as loud and vicious as the storm which quaked the sky above, and knocked corbec back two, three steps with blow after blow. corbec's mouth was split open and his nose broken, flooding his beard with blood. corbec ducked in low, throwing punches before he shoulder-charged gilbear off his feet. corbec lurched the massive blueblood backwards on his shoulder, legs dangling, then twisted and threw him over himself in a perfect wrestling move, slamming gilbear down into the creek on his back. corbec kicked him for good measure. trooper alhac, a blueblood, was pounding his hands together wildly until he realised his side had lost. he was about to turn his venom on the cheering tanith beside him when the undergrowth to his left flickered. alhac froze. so did the ghost he was about to strike. something black and abominable grew out of the jumping lights in the thicket. alhac died, cut into streaks of evaporating flesh. the ghost beside him perished the same way a second later. then another blueblood, skinned in an instant. the other ghosts and bluebloods who had been cheering the fight from the creek edge fled in panic. corbec spat. barked gilbear. the dog-thing leapt down into the creek and began to pound towards them. corbec and gilbear turned and ran as fast as they could through the root-twisted waterway. it was right behind them, baying. the thing leapt on gilbear and dragged him down, ripping at his carapace armour with its tusks. strips of armaplas shredded off his shoulder panels. corbec shouted, riding the beast, pulling its skull back. gilbear pulled a frag grenade from his belt and threw it straight into the beast's mouth, right down its gullet past the wincing pink larynx. gilbear threw himself down and corbec propelled himself clear. the dog-thing exploded from within, showering both them and the creek bed with stinking meat. corbec pulled himself up out of the fluid muck at the bottom of the watercourse. he looked across at gilbear, sat with his back against the creek wall, eyes straining. gilbear nodded again. no idea. big, old, fortified. it's on top of a mound that i don't think is natural. too regular. all i know is, the enemy are surrounding it thicker than sap-flies round a glucose trap. gaunt wondered out loud. gaunt turned to look at him. gaunt looked at lilith. gaunt nodded. he was about to call up raglon and issue new orders to advance when the dull crump of a frag grenade rolled through the storm. a few moments later, lasguns and hellguns were firing, sporadic, the distinctive crack of laser fire overlapping the higher shriek of hell-shots. gaunt scrambled down the bank, pulling out his chainsword, shouting for reports. sergeant lerod was directing the men in the east flank of the picket. there are things coming out of the storm, sir! brutes! gaunt peered out into the dark jungle, and saw scuttling monstrosities being born out of tendrils of lightning. there was a sickening whiff of chaos. manifestations of this unholy storm. gaunt to brigade. we're advancing, double time. spearhead formation. tanith first platoon and half the volpone unit at the point. take your direction from scout-trooper mkoll. everyone else, watch the flanks and the rear. inquisitor lilith instructs that warp-spawn could appear around or among us at any time. don't hesitate; shoot. sergeant lerod, take a six-man drill and guard the back of the formation. all commanders acknowledge understanding of these orders and signal readiness. like a single, lithe entity, the brigade swept up the escarpment, pushing onwards into the jagged hills as the storm shook the world around them. blueblood and ghost moved in perfect, trained order together, all animosities set aside. gaunt smiled as he observed the tight drilled formation of his own, and was suitably impressed that it was matched by the bulky volpone elite. every now and then, las-shots sang out from the vanguard as warp-things were sighted and dispatched. lilith moved with him. got them motivated. lilith produced something from her pocket. the brigade moved down a deep defile into a tree-sheltered vale that blocked the raging storm partially for the first time. gaunt was becoming numb with the incessant wind and rain, and knew his men must be too. it was a blessed, temporary relief to move through the deep gorge with its almost cathedral-like arches of ancient cattails and clopeas, where rain arrested by the leaf canopy simply drooled down to the ground in long, slow, sappy streams. the storm raged, muffled, far above them. mkoll closed his eyes and saw eiloni just ahead, beckoning him back to the farmstead. she was whispering promises of a hot supper, and of rowdy boys ready for one of their father's fireside tales before bed. the advancing tide of chaos warriors only stopped when the numbers of their dead choked the passageway. rawne ordered his platoon back and they hauled a set of double doors closed, barring them to seal the tunnel. milo helped wheln swing the doors shut, his fingers tracing the heraldic badge of the tanith elector inscribed on the heavy nal-wood panels.  he blinked, and for a second saw taller, more slender doors of polished onyx, marked with alien runes he did not understand. wheln asked, panting. milo blinked again. the doors were arched nal-wood in the tanith pattern again, the elector's insignia clearly marked. feygor and mkendrik dropped a long bar across the door loops to lock it tight. beyond the thick barrier, they could hear muffled explosions and the rasp of flamers as the enemy tried to unblock the corpse-packed tunnel. the eight tanith men were exhausted. a day ago, at the founding, none of them � with the possible exception of rawne and feygor � had ever fired a weapon in anger, let alone killed. now they were truly baptised. there was no counting the dead they had piled up. gown sank to his heels against the wall, fighting for breath. he asked. feygor snarled into milo's face. milo winced as spittle hit his cheek. caffran pulled feygor back from milo sharply. the young trooper's face was bright with passion. the thought of laria burned in his mind. wheln and cown both nodded in agreement. spat cown. feygor, subdued, turned and nodded, deftly exchanging the power cell of his lasgun for a fresh one. rawne had been absent for a few moments and now strode back into view. rawne nodded. for the elector! rawne yelled as he blasted. the big colonel hesitated again, then returned his attention to the killing. muon nol, of the dire avengers aspect, had been holding the green onyx vault with a squad of his warriors, seeing them cut down one by one as chaos forced their way into the chamber via the diamond-shaped prayer chute at the end, under the rosette of spirit stones set high in the wall beneath the wraith-silk standard of dolthe. the only cover was the tangled mess of psycho-plastic benches which had once lined the celebrant vault, benches that had been splintered or wilted by enemy fire. to the side of them, slender pointed windows paned with translucent wraith-bone showed images of asuryan, the phoenix king, khaine of the bloody hand, vaul, the crippled smith-god, morai-heg the fate-crone, and lileath the maiden, goddess of dream fortune, backlit by farseer fon kull's warp-storm outside. it was lileath who muon nol most worshipped, that beautiful diviner of futures and possibilities. he wore her rune on a thread around his neck, under his jade-blue aspect armour. muon nol's white crested helmet was dinted with black las-scores, and the red plume crest was singed.  still uliowye, lord fon kull's holy buanna, spat whickering onslaughts of jagged, flickering star-rounds at the foe, slicing them to pieces, a thousand rounds in each tight burst. the stabilising gyros whirred as the great, ornate shrieker cannon bucked in his mesh-gloved hands. the accelerator field shimmered around the muzzle base, uliowye, the kiss of sharp stars. he had perhaps six rods of solid ammunition left; he would make them count. for lileath, he would make them count. for dolthe. suddenly, eight humans in drab, muddy uniforms fell in beside him, blasting their lasguns at the enemy. they were resilient and fierce, and seemed to show no shock or surprise at their surroundings or sudden, new-found comradesin- arms. psychically, muon nol ordered his remaining men to accept them and fight on. this was undoubtedly lord eon kull's work � and lord eon kull's deceit. and, khaine, but these mon-keigh fought! like they were fighting for their own homeworld it seemed, fighting for everything they loved! in under five minutes the reinforcement of the human soldiers had driven the chaos spawn back. they pushed forward together down the prayer chute and killed the last of the attackers, closing a great stone hatch shut to block the rest. the master of the bodyguard turned to the slim, dark-haired human who appeared to be the newcomers' leader. he searched for his grasp of low gothic, as he had learned in the training symposiums of dolthe craftworld. good to see you boys, and no mistake. the elector needs all the men he can get right now. i'm rawne, major, commanding� well, what's left of third platoon. place us where you want us, colonel. they were out on the battlements now, enemy fire ripping over them. colonel munnol called to his tanith soldiers, who looked around from the loopholes and crenellations where they had been firing down at the foe. white hair, streaked with red, thought milo with a shudder. they all have white hair. munnol exclaimed. dolthe? dolthe? where was that? milo wondered. a rousing cheer greeted colonel munnol's words. rawne ordered the third in alongside the tanith already in place, taking position and firing down into the stormy dark over the jagged lip of laser-chewed stonework. milo was about to take his place when he saw larkin was cowering behind them all, crouched in the corner of the battlement away from the fight, clutching his sniper rifle and shaking uncontrollably. milo snatched the sniper gun out of larkin's wavering hands, and sighted it at munnol, looking through the scope. the bead of the blue light beam kissed munnol's drab camo-cloak like a tiny spotlight. milo looked through the scope viewer, seeing munnol as a ghost of blues and shadows. munnol, as if sensing the beam on him, turned to look back at milo. through the scope, milo saw munnol as he swung slowly around, his eyes hooked and slanted in his cold pale face. a second more, and those eyes became the visor slits of a great sculpted helmet of gleaming white armour, backed by a towering crest of red feathers. munnol's grey fatigues became a tight suit of blue armour that locked majestically about his huge, powerful frame. the lasgun in his hands became a long, fluted lance weapon with a ridged, coiled pipe, silver vents and a beautiful inlay of chased pearl and gold. munnol became quite the most frightening thing milo had ever seen. lilith's brigade broke from the gorge into a fan of lowlands where the jungle had vanished under sculptural folds of mud which had slid in vast curls down the slopes and obliterated everything in their path. the going was slower, the troops wading waist-deep in ochre slime in some places. above the roar of the storm, the forward scouts could now pick up the sounds of massed combat from the valley beyond. hashes of light backlit the hilltop, and it wasn't lightning. gaunt ordered battle readiness via an encrypted vox-burst, marshalling the volpone heavyweights up the flank of the hill under gilbear's lead and funnelling the ghosts in two detachments led by lerod and corbec along the edge of the mud slip below. gaunt and lilith moved at the front of corbec's band. mkoll had led them true. round the curve of the hill, they got their first sight of the mound and its ruin � and the massed forces of the enemy surrounding it.  even prepared by mkoll's description, gaunt found the scale was immense. thousands of enemy troops, some with heavy weapons, were swarming the mound's slopes and bombarding the great, dark edifice with a force stone had no right to resist. the entire scene was a flickering mess of fire-flashes and explosions. the wet air was pungent with blood and thermite. the guardsmen were engaging before they realised it. gilbear's bluebloods had come into the rear positions of enemy heavy weapons emplacements, and the crews were turning, startled, counter-attacking with close-quarter side arms. a moment later, and both detachments of ghosts were hemmed in by chaos units that peeled back from the main assault to face this surprise rear contact. las-fire and bolt rounds seared a miserable light-streak criss-cross over the smooth mud flats. blasting with his bolt pistol, gaunt saw a tiny opportunity: break and fall back now, or become locked irrevocably into the fighting. he saw gilbear's unit spill down the rise and fall upon the enemy weapon stations with a ferocious and admirable grace, overwhelming and slaughtering them in a matter of a minute or two. the powerful hellguns, supported by two grenade launchers and a plasma rifleman, ripped into the hindquarters of the guncrews' position and cut them down. gilbear haughtily voxed his success as his men took over control of the enemy weapons, turning missile launchers and field artillery on the ranks of the chaos army beyond. the volpone tenth elite were damn good, gaunt had to admit. rotation training on all combat disciplines meant that they could take a gun post and then man that gun as surely and deftly as if they were dedicated artillery troops. gaunt knew the moment had gone. to break now would have left the volpone alone. his choice was made for him. battle was truly joined and there would be no respite. the twin prongs of the ghosts punched into the rear of the besiegers. gilbear, tactically astute, turned the aim of captured guns down the turn of the valley and covered the ghost push, creating huge breaks in the enemy's makeshift flanking manoeuvre. shells whistled down under gilbear's direction, pin-point accurate, throwing ribbons of mud, strands of foliage and pieces of chaos troopers into the air not twenty metres in front of the advancing ghosts. the fighting was close range and white hot. incredibly, but for a few grazes and glancing burns, gaunt found his men suffered no casualties. within five minutes of first contact, the imperials had cut a wedge into the enemy rearguard, made up half a kilometre of ground and slaughtered upwards of two hundred enemy troops, at no mortal cost. gilbear held the line as long as he could, but there came a point, mutually agreed between him and gaunt over the vox-link, when the separation of the two small imperial advances would become too great. when the signal was given, the bluebloods mined the gun emplacements and pushed on, scything a double-time advance to swing themselves in behind the ghosts. limed explosions, staggered and staggering, set off the emplacement munitions and excavated a new valley where a small plateau had been. into the heat now, on the lower slopes of the mound, the imperial expedition force slicing a break in the foe as a spearhead formation, ghosts to the right, volpone to the left, with gaunt and corbec at the tip. gaunt knew the tanith fought well, but he had never seen them discharge themselves so determinedly, so brilliantly. in his heart, he couldn't believe that this was a simple response to his motivational speech. they were fighting for something, something deep in theirs hearts, something that would not be denied. what? can't you feel it? you're a ghost, ibram gaunt, whether you know it or not! gaunt pulled off his cap and wiped brow-sweat back into his cropped hair. he was panting, painfully high on adrenaline. at the head of his wave of bluebloods, gilbear heard the call and screamed into the night as he emptied yet another power-pack out through the glowing muzzle of his hellgun. the volpone took the rise, scattering enemy before them. lerod, who now thought himself truly immortal, led his detachment up the mound, stampeding over the panicking, splintering waves of chaos filth. corbec, with bragg firing solid lines of destruction from his heavy weapon at his side, pushed the other ghost band up between the prongs. to either side of the imperial advance, a hundred thousand soldiers of the foe swarmed and regrouped. but the sixty or so imperials cut a line up through them that wouldn't be denied. years later, painstakingly reconstructing the details of this assault from patchy data collected at the time, imperial tacticians on london would be utterly unable to account for the success of the action. even given the surprise nature of the assault, from the rear, there was no sense to the data. simple statistics should have had gaunt's expeditionary force cut down to the last man, at most a half kilometre from the ruin. the tacticians would factor in charismatic leadership, tactical insight, luck� and still there was no mistake. gaunt's men should have been entirely slaughtered long before they reached the ruin. but that was not the case. gaunt drew his forces, without the loss of a single man, up to the walls of the ruin perhaps thirty minutes after they had first engaged the back of the enemy positions. they had cut through a legion of the foe who outnumbered them ten thousand to one, and attained a target area the enemy had been trying to force its way into for hours. they slew, approximately, two-point-four thousand soldiers of the enemy. eventually, after a prolonged analytical study, the tacticians would decide that the only explanation could be that there were no enemy units on the field that day. it was all an illusion. gaunt had mounted an assault through open, undefended ground. only then did the computations and the statistics and the possibilities match up. none of them could admit that this wasn't the case. and so, perhaps the greatest and most spectacular success of macaroth's great crusade, out-classed and out-numbered but still successful, was deleted from the imperial annals as a phantom engagement. such is the fate of true heroism. there was a door: a tall, pointed arch of stone faced with stone, in the side of the smooth flank of the ruin. gaunt grouped his force around it as relentless firepower strafed up at them from the muddled but regrouping legions of the enemy. gilbear intended to mine the door in the hope of blowing it open, though, as corbec pointed out, the scorch marks on the stone facing seemed to indicate that the enemy had tried that more than once and failed. they were about to argue the point some more when the door opened. brin milo stood there, looking out at them, flanked by caffran and a spectacularly grim eldar warrior with a red plume set behind his white helmet. the storm flashed above, still furious and wild. sealed inside the onyx walls of the way-place, gaunt and his force heard the low wailing of eldar mourners, remorsefully singing the last songs of closure. muon lord eon kull felt the wash and burn of the chaos hosts as they assaulted the ruin around him. fuehain falchior had begun to rattle in her rack again. the door of the inner place slid open and muon nol entered, escorting a cowled human female, a hulking stormtrooper in grey and gold, and a human male in a long coat and cap. muon nol bowed. lilith did likewise. gilbear and gaunt remained upright. eon kull spoke, perfectly using the clumsy low gothic he had once wasted a brief year mastering. muon nol took a step forward, gesturing to indicate lilith. holding eon kull, gaunt looked up hopelessly at lilith. she came and took his place, embracing the frail eldar's head and body. gaunt launched himself forward, bringing down muon nol before the enraged eldar could splinter gilbear to pieces with his shrieker cannon. gaunt got up off the aspect warrior and strode across the onyx room to face gilbear. gaunt turned as lilith cried out. she was cradling eon kull in her arms.  gaunt rushed to her, with muon nol at his elbow, but there was no mistaking the signs. farseer eon kull, the old one, was dead. they placed his frail remains on the floor. muon nol and lilith looked at him. lilith looked at gaunt. �heironymo sondar, house sondar, from his inaugural address the klaxons began to wail, though it was still an hour or more to shift-rotation. the people of the hive-city paused as one. millions of eyes checked timepieces, faltered in their work, looked up at the noise. conversations trailed off. feeble jokes were cracked to hide unease. young children began to cry. house soldiery on the curtain wall voxed in confirmation and clarification requests to the main spine command station. line supervisors and labour-stewards in the plants and manufactories chivvied their personnel back into production, but they were uneasy too. it was a test, surely? or a mistake. a few moments more and the alarms would shut down again. but the klaxons did not desist. after a minute or so, raid-sirens in the central district also began keening. the pattern was picked up by manufactory hooters and mill-whistles all through the lower hive, and in the docks and outer habs across the river too. even the great ceremonial horns on the top of the ecclesiarchy basilica started to sound. vervunhive was screaming with every one of its voices. everywhere, hazard lamps began to spin and flash, and secondary storm shutters cycled down on automatic to block windows. all the public-address plates in the city went black, erasing the glowing lines of weather, temperature, exchange-rate data, the local news and the ongoing output figures. in the firelit halls of vervun smeltery one � part of the primary ore processing district just west of the spoil � rattling conveyers laden with unprocessed rock shuddered to a halt as automatic safeties locked down. above the main smelter silo, plant supervisor agun soric got up from behind a file-covered desk and crossed to the stainedglass window of his bureau. he looked down at the vast, halted plant in disbelief, then pulled on his work-jacket and went out onto the catwalk, staring at the thousands of milling workers below. vor, his junior, hurried along the walk, his heavily booted feet ringing on the metal grill, the sound lost in the cacophony of hooters and sirens. soric shook his head. use your brain! and too young to remember, he thought. gak, he was too young himself, but his father's father had told him about the trade war. what was it, ninety years back, standard? surely not again? but the picts had been full of it these last few months: zoica silent, zoica ceasing to trade, zoica raising its bulwarks and setting armaments up along its northern walls. those raid-sirens hadn't sounded since the trade war. soric knew that as a bare fact. * * * in the commercia, the general mercantile district north of the main spine, in the shadow of the shield pylon, guilder amchanduste worlin tried to calm the buyers in his barter-house, but the sirens drowned him out. the retinues were leaving, gathering up servant trains and produce bearers, making frantic calls on their vox-links, leaving behind nothing: not a form-contract, not a promissory note, not a business slate and certainly none of their funds. worlin put his hands to his head and cursed. his embroidered, sleet-silk gown felt suddenly hot and heavy . he yelled for his bodyguards and they appeared: menx and troor, bull-necked men in ivory-laced body-gloves with the crest of guild worlin branded on their cheeks. they nodded and went off, pushing through the packs of departing traders. worlin paced back into his private ante-room behind the auction hall, cursing at the sirens to shut up. the very last thing he needed now was an interruption to trade. he'd spent months and a great deal of guild worlin funds securing mercantile bonds with noble house yetch and four of the houses ordinary. all of that work would be for nothing if trade � and income � went slack. the whole deal could collapse. his kin would be aghast at such losses. they might even strip him of his badge and remove his trading rights. worlin was shaking. he crossed to the decanter on the wrought-brass stack table and was about to pour himself a hefty shot of ten-year-old joiliq to calm his brittle mood. but he paused. he went to his desk, unlocked a drawer with the geno-key that he kept around his wrist on a thin chain and took out the compact needle pistol. he checked it was primed and armed, then fetched the drink. he sat back on his lifter throne, sipping his liquor and holding his badge of credit � the mark of his rank � gazing at the worlin crest and its bright ornament. he waited, the weapon in his lap. the klaxons continued to wail. at carriage station c4/a, panic had begun. workers and low-classers who had ventured into the mercantile slopes for a day's resourcing began to mob every brass-framed transit that trundled in along the cogged, funicular trackway. carriages were moving out towards the outer habs and the main spine alike, overloaded, some doors only half closed. crowds on the platforms, shivering at each yelp of the alarms, were getting fractious as more and more fully laden transits clattered through without stopping. a slate-seller's stall was overturned in the press. livy kolea, hab-wife, was beginning to panic herself. a body-surge of the crowd had pushed her past the pillars of the station atrium. she'd kept a firm grip on the handles of the child-cart and yoncy was safe, but she'd lost sight of dalin. she grabbed a passing guilder by the sleeve. a rich, lavish sleeve of painted silk. the guilder's bodyguard, menacing in his rust-coloured mesh, pushed her aside.  yoncy was laughing, oblivious in his woollen wrap. livy bent down under the segmented hood of the cart to stroke him, whispering soft, motherly words. but her mind was racing. people slammed into her, teetering the cart and she had to hold on to keep it upright. why was this happening � to her � now? why was it happening on the one day a month she carriaged into the lower commercia to haggle for stuff? gol had wanted a new pair of canvas mittens. his hands were so sore after a shift at the ore face. it was such a simple thing. now this! and she hadn't even got the mittens. she called. livy embraced her ten-year-old son with fury and conviction, like she would never let go. livy looked up, not breaking her hug. the girl was about sixteen, she reckoned, a slut from the outer habs, wearing the brands and piercings of a hab-ganger. the girl stepped in front of the cart as livy tried to turn it. the girl backed off, smiling. no! livy barked and pushed the gang-girl aside with the cart. the river tides were ebbing and thick, ore-rich spumes were coursing down the waters of the hass. longshoreman folik edged his dirty, juddering flatbed ferry, the magnificat, out from the north shore and began the eight-minute crossing to the main wharves. the diesel motor coughed and spluttered. folik eased the revs and coasted between garbage scows and derelicts, following the dredged channel. grey estuary birds, with hooked pink beaks, rose from the scows in a raucous swirl. to the magnificat's port side, the stone stilts of the hass viaduct, two hundred metres tall, cast long, cold shadows across the water. those damn sirens! what was that about? mincer sat at the prow, watching the low-water for new impediments. he gestured and folik inched the ferry to starboard, swishing in between the trash hulks and the river-sound buoys. folik could see the crowds on the jetty. big crowds. he grinned to himself. mincer shouted, unlooping the tarred rope from the catheads. she froze, catching sight of her own pale, startled face in the dressing mirror. the klaxons were distant, almost plaintive, from up here in mid-spine, but local alarms shortly joined in. her handmaids came rushing in from the cloth-maker's vestibule and helped her lace up her own dress. maid wholt sniggered. squealed maid francer. merity ordered. she pulled her muslin fichu around her shoulders and fastened the pin. then she picked up her credit wand from the top of the rosewood credenza. though the wand was a tool that gave her access to her personal expense account in the house chass treasury, it was ornamental in design, a delicate lace fan which she flipped open and waved in front of her face as the built-in ioniser hummed. the maids looked down, stifling enthusiastic giggles. head high, she led her giggling maids out of the thickly carpeted gown-hall, through drapes that drew back automatically at their approach and out into the perfumed elegance of the promenade. gol kolea put down his axe-rake and pulled off his head-lamp. his hands were bloody and sore. the air was black with rock-soot, like fog. gol sucked a mouthful of electrolyte fluid from his drinking pipe and refastened it to his collar. he asked trug vereas. okay� gol swung his axe-rake and dug in. he just wished the scrape and crack of his blade would drown out the distant sirens. captain ban daur paused to button his double-breasted uniform coat and pull the leather harness into place. he forced his mind to be calm. as an officer, he would have been informed of any drill and usually he got wind even of surprise practises. but this was real. he could feel it. he picked up his gloves and his spiked helmet and left his quarters. the corridors of the hass west wall-fort were bustling with troop details. all wore the blue cloth uniform and spiked helmets of the vervun primary, the city's standing army. five hundred thousand troops all told, plus another 70,000 auxiliaries and armour crews, a mighty force that manned the curtain wall and the wall forts of vervunhive. the regiment had a noble heritage and had proved itself in the trade war, from which time they had been maintained as a permanent institution. when foundings were ordered for the imperial guard, vervunhive raised them from its forty billion-plus population. the men of vervun primary were never touched or transferred. it was a life-duty, a career. but though their predecessors had fought bravely, none of the men currently composing the ranks of vervun primary had ever seen combat. daur barked out a few commands to calm the commotion in the hallway.  he was young, only twenty-three, but tall and cleanly handsome, from a good mid-spine family and the men liked him. they seemed to relax a little, seeing him so calm. let's pretend we've actually been trained, shall we? daur headed uptower, pulling out his autopistol and checking its clip. corporal bendace met him on the steps. no. it doesn't say anything. it's just a deployment order from house command in the spine. all units are to take position, protocol gamma sigma. define �bad'? daur to all hass west area positions. reel it off. in the vast square of marshals, just inside the curtain wall, adjacent to the heironymo sondar gate, the air shook with the thunder of three hundred tank engines. huge leman russ war-machines, painted in the blue livery of vervun primary, revved at idle in rows across the square. more vehicles clanked and ground their way in at the back of the square, from the marshalling sheds behind the south-hive barracks. general vegolain of the first primary armoured, jumped down from his mount, buckling on his leather headshield, and approached the commissar. he had just arrived in the square by staff limousine, a sinister black vehicle that was now pulling away behind its motorbike escorts. there were two other commissars with him: langana and the cadet fosker. kowle was a tall, lean man who looked as if he had been forced to wear the black cap and longcoat of an imperial commissar. his skin was sallow and taut, and his eyes were a disturbing beige. unlike langana and fosker, kowle was an off-worlder. the senior commissar was imperial guard, seconded to watch over the vervunhive standing army as a concession to its continued maintenance. kowle quietly despised his post. his promising career with the fadayhin fifth had foundered some years before and against his will he had been posted to wet-nurse this toy army. now, at last, he tasted the possibility of acquiring some glory that might rejuvenate his lustreless career. langana and fosker were hive-bred, both from aspiring houses. their uniform showed their difference from kowle. in place of his imperial double-eagle pins, they wore the axe-rake symbol of the vphc, the vervun primary hive commissariat, the disciplinary arm of the standing army. the sondar nobility was keen on discipline. some even said that the vphc was almost a secret police force, acting beyond the reach of the administratum, in the interests of the ruling house. he handed vegolain a data-slate. kowle snapped. , it is no one. kowle didn't reply. he marched across to vegolain's leman russ and clambered aboard. three minutes later, the sondar gate opened with a great shriek of hydraulic compressors and the armoured column poured out onto the main south highway in triple file. who? this is not disobedience, high one. this is duty. and i will not speak to your puppets. the cherub swung abruptly round into gnide's face. sub-dermal tensors pulled its bloated mouth into a grin that was utterly unmatched by its dead eyes. gnide pushed the dangling cherub aside, flinching at the touch of its pallid flesh on his hand. snapped gnide. the girl hissed, flatly. this is not usurpation, high one. vervunhive is in danger. the three voices asked as one. the three voices rose in a shrill chorus, the meat puppets quivering with unknowable rage. gnide pulled a glittering ducal seal from his coat. he pressed the switches in series, activating the power generators deep beneath the hive. he entered the sequences that would engage the main transmission pylon and bring the shield online. the cherub flew at him. he batted it away and it upturned, tangling in its cords. gnide punched in the last sequence and reached for the activation lever. he gasped and fell back, reaching behind him. the girl puppet jerked away, a long blade wedged in her dead hands. the blade was dark with blood. gnide tried to close the gouting wound in his lower back. his knees gave and he fell. the girl swung in again and stuck the blade through his throat. he fell, face down, soaking the carpet with his pumping blood. the cherub and youth repeated it, dull and toneless. inside the iron tank, bathed in warm ichor and floating free, every organ and vessel connected by tubes to the lifebank, salvador sondar, high master of vervunhive� dreamed. the salt grasses were ablaze. all along the scarp rise, vervun primary tanks were buckled and broken amid the rippling, grey grass, fire spilling out of them. the air was toxic with smoke. commissar kowle dropped clear of the command tank as flames within consumed the shrieking vegolain and his crew. kowle's coat was on fire. he shed it. enemy fire pummelled down out of the smoke-black air. a vervun tank a hundred metres away exploded and sent shockwaves of whickering shrapnel in all directions. one shard grazed kowle's temple and dropped him. he got up again. crews were bailing from burning tanks, some on fire, some trying to help their blazing fellows. others ran. kowle walked back through the line of decimated hive armour, smelling the salt grass as it burned, thick and rancid in his nose. he pulled out his pistol. turn! face the foe! livy! s'okay, kid. s'okay. i see lights, sir. a transit approaches. captain daur to marshal gnide! give us permission to arm! give the order! in the dull quiet of the audience chamber, gnide's corpse was lifted away from the carpet by the slack puppets. the desperate voice of daur and hundreds of other field commanders bayed unheard from his vox-plug. three shells hit hass west fort in series. the first ignited the battery munitions. the second vaporised corporal bendace and sixteen other troopers. the third, a crippling shockwave, splintered the tower top and caused a vast chunk of rampart to slump away in a torrent of stone, dust and fire. captain daur fell with it, caught in the avalanche of rockcrete and ceramite. fie had still not received the order to arm from the house command. in the iron tank, salvador sondar, high master of vervunhive, drifted and dreamed. the satisfaction he had gained from asserting his mastery over that fool gnide was ebbing. there was something akin to pain creeping into him across the mind-impulse links that hooked his cortex into the data-tides and production autoledgers of the hive. he rolled over in the warm suspension fluid and accessed the information currents of the legislature and the guilds. the hive was� under attack. he retuned his link to confirm. even when the information was verified, it seemed wrong. there was a discrepancy that his mind could not resolve. vervunhive was attacked. yet this should not be. he needed time to think. petulantly, he activated the shield generators. �pius kowle, imperial commissar, from his public education leaflets dusk came early at the end of the first day. the darkening sky was stained darker still by the smoke plumes rising from the hive and its outer districts, and by the great ashen pall looming over the salt grasslands to the south. thick, fire-swollen, black smoke boiled up from the mining district and the heavy industrial suburbs south of the curtain wall, and a murky brown flare of burning fuel rose from ruptured tanks and silos on the hass docks to the north of the river. other threads of white, grey and mauve smoke rose from hundreds of smaller, individual fires. the bombardment continued, even though the shield had been raised. a vast, translucent umbrella of field-energy extended out from the great shield pylon in the central district and unfurled itself in a dome that reached down to anchor substations inside the curtain wall. thousands of shells and missiles burst against it every minute, dimpling the cloudy energy and making it ripple and wobble like green gelatine. from inside the shield, it looked as if the green sky was blossoming with fire. observers on the southern wall, most of them soldiers of vervun primary, trained their scopes and magnoculars through the rising smoke and fires in the outer habs and saw the distant grass horizon flickering with a wall of flame seventy kilometres wide. the grass smoke � ash-grey but streaked with black from individual infernos down below the skyline � tarnished the southern sky in the dying light. bright, brief flashes underlit the horizon smoke, hinting at the fierce armour battle taking place just out of sight. no communications had been received from general vegolain's armoured column for two hours. now that the shield was up to cover the main hive, the outer habs, the heavy industry sectors and the mining district south of the wall were taking the worst of it. unprotected, they were raked mercilessly by long-range artillery, siege mortars and incendiary rockets. as the light faded, the southern out-hive suburb became a dark, mangled mass, busy with thousands of fires, drizzled by fresh rains of explosives. from the wall, it was possible to see the shock waves radiating from each major strike, gusting the existing fires. the population of the southern outer habs was in the order of nine million, plus another six million workers who dwelt in the main hive but travelled out to work the industrial district and the mines. they had little shelter. some hid in cellars or underground storage bays and many died entombed in these places. penetrator shells dug them out explosively like rats, opening the makeshift shelters to the sky. others were sealed forever under thousands of tonnes of collapsed masonry. there were a few deep-seated, hardpoint shelters in the southern habs, reserved for suburban officials and minor area legislators. these shelters had been dug ninety years before during the trade war and few were in decent working order. one group of hab officials spent two hours trying to find the correct rune-code to let them into their assigned shelter and they were incinerated by a rocket before they could get the vault door open. another group, a few blocks north, found themselves fighting off a terrified mob that wanted to gain access to a shelter too. a vphc officer, leading the group, opened fire with his handgun to drive the frantic citizens away while the ranking official, a mill-boss with guild connections, opened the vault. they sealed themselves in, twenty-three rank-privileged citizens of authority level three or less, in a bunker emplacement designed to shelter two hundred. they all died of suffocation by the following dawn. the air systems, long in need of overhaul and regular maintenance, failed the moment they were switched on. by nightfall, millions of refugees were clogging the main arterial routes into the hive, bottled up at sondar gate, at the hass west road entry and the ore works cargo route. they were even trying to gain access via the rail-link tunnel at veyveyr gate, but the terminal inside had been turned into an inferno in the first wave of bombing and the gate was blocked. others still, in desperate, slowly moving lines, many laden with possessions or injured family members, dared the spoil and the mud flats, and some made it in through the as-yet-undamaged railhead at croe gate. the hass west fort was still burning and the top of it was cascading debris down both inside and outside the wall. however, the wall and the hass gate itself were still firm and streams of refugees made it into the hive via the hass road under supervision of vervun primary troopers manning the damaged emplacement. but access was still slow and a column of people, two kilometres long and growing, tailed back from the hass gate into the dark, vulnerable to the ceaseless onslaught pummelling the outer habs. thousands died before they could pass into shelter, as shells landed in the thick queue, lust as many, perhaps eight or nine thousand, fled the traffic stream northwest and made progress into the river shores. the last kinking stretch of shield wall north of hass west fort, known as the dock wall, reached out into the midwaters and there was no way through. some perished in the treacherous mud-flats; others tried to swim the hass itself and were lost by the hundreds.  most cowered in the stinking slime under the dock wall, wailing plaintively up at the soldiers two hundred metres above them on the wall top, men who could do nothing to help them. almost two thousand people remained penned in that filthy corner of the wall through the first days of the conflict, too afraid to try the route back round the wall to hass gate. starvation, disease and despair killed them all within four days. the sondar gate was open and the main tide of refugees sought entry there. the vervun primary troops, focussed en masse to control the crowd, admitted the people as quickly as possible, but it was miserably slow going and the column of people stretched three kilometres back into the burning outer habs. many of the tail-enders, certain they would be dead before ever reaching the safety of the hive's shield, turned around and headed out into the salt grasslands by the hundreds. none were ever seen alive again. in the square of marshals, just inside the heironymo sondar gate, the hive troopers struggled to manage the overwhelming influx of citizens. forty percent of the arrivals were injured. captain letro cargin had been given charge of the operation and inside an hour he was close to despair. he had first tried to contain the refugees in the vast ceremonial square itself, but it quickly became filled to overflowing. some family groups were climbing the pedestals of the statues around the square to find somewhere to crouch. there was group singing: work anthems of the hive or imperial hymns. the massed, frail voices � set against the constant thunder of the bombardment and the crackle of the shield above � unnerved his men. the vervun primary barracks northwest of the square, which had taken hits in the first stage of the attack, was still blazing but under control. cargin voxed house command repeatedly until he was granted special permission from the guilds to open the anko chemical plant west of the square and the guild manufactories to the east, to house the overspill. quickly, these new areas became overfilled too. the guilds had issued particular instructions as to how much of those areas could be used or even entered. cargin's men reported fights breaking out as they tried to deny access to certain areas. shots were fired over the heads of the crowd. compared to the onslaught they had weathered outside, the small arms of the troops were insignificant and the house guard found themselves pushed back deeper into the industrial areas, trying to accommodate the intake. most troopers were profoundly unwilling to shoot at their own citizens. in one instance, an angry junior officer actually fired into the encroaching crowd, killing two. he and his six man squad were torn apart by a pack of smoke-blackened textile workers. cargin voxed frantically for supplies and advice. by eight in the evening, new orders were being issued from house command and the legislature, designating refugee assembly areas, hastily arranged in the inner worker habs south of the pylon and the commercia. asylum traffic from the sondar gate, hass gate and, to a lesser extent, the croe gate was now choking the southern sectors of the hive. some of the house legislature, meeting in extraordinary session in the main spine, argued that it was the hive's duty to house the outer hab population. others were simply afraid that with the main southern arterials choked, they would never be able to mobilise their armies. six noble houses also volunteered aid, which began to be shipped by carriage route down to the square of marshals and the main city landing field where the refugees from hass gate were also congregating. it was a start, but not enough. cargin began to wonder if the upper echelon of the hive really understood the scale of the problem. the imperial mottoes, hive slogans and other messages of calming propaganda flashing up on the public-address plates did little to deaden the general panic. cargin had angry, frightened citizens by the thousands, most stone-deaf from concussion shock, many burned naked by the blasts, many more dying and stretcher-bound. short of closing the gate itself, he had no way to stem the flow. his three thousand men were vastly outnumbered by the mass. cargin was voxed to the north corner of the square. there he found a field station had been set up by medics from some inner hab infirmary. hundreds of the injured had been laid out on the stone paving. cargin looked round. a gowned and masked figure was addressing him. she pulled off her mask to reveal an appealing, heart-shaped face. cargin nodded. the tank roared and bounced over the trampled grass hillocks, heading north at full throttle, its turret reversed to spit shells into the firefields behind it, into the invisible enemy at its heels. the night sky was ablaze. scorching trails of rockets and shrieking shells tore overhead, heading for the hive. commissar kowle crouched in the turret of the running tank, shouting orders to fire to the gun-crew in the lit space below him. the vox-link was down. he couldn't reach house command. he had forty-two tanks left out of the armoured column of more than four hundred and fifty that had left the sondar gate that afternoon. no ranking vervun primary armour officer was left alive. cadet fosker was also dead. kowle had command now. using the vphc commissar langana as his second officer, he had managed to regroup the shattered remnants of the tank force and swing it back towards the city. it felt like retreat, but kowle knew it was a sound tactical decision. they were facing an ochre wave out there on the grass-flats, a stupendous zoica armoured front, pushing in through three salients. only in his days with the imperial guard, during major offensives like balhaut and cociaminus, had he seen anything like this scale of assault.  and there were infantry regiments behind, thick like locusts, following the armour. kowle didn't even want to think about the size of the opposition just now. it was� unbelievable. it was impossible. an ochre wave � that's all he could see, the tide of ochre-painted machines rolling over his forces, crushing them. he tried the vox again, but the enemy was jamming all bands. shells rained down amongst the retreating vervun tanks. at least two blew out as munitions ignited, sending tank hulls end-over-end in fireballs, spraying track segments out like shattered teeth. the driver was calling him over the intercom. kowle swivelled round. vervunhive was in sight now, the great luminous blister of green energy flickering on the skyline like a giant mushroom cloud, glowing in the night. kowle grabbed his scope and saw the blackened, burning mass of the outer habs fast approaching. he smiled at his last words. even now, under a storm of fire, he could still turn a good, disciplinarian phrase. the high-ceilinged, gilt-ornamented hall of the legislature, high and secure in the upper sections of the main spine, was full of arguing voices. lord heymlik chass, noble patriarch of house chass, sat back in his velvet-upholstered bench and glanced aside to his aides and chamberlains. the legislature was full tonight. all nine noble houses were in attendance, as well as the representatives of the other twenty-one houses ordinary, along with the drones of over three hundred guild associations and families in their flamboyant finery. and down in the commons pit, hundreds of habitat and work-clave representatives bayed for action. as a scion of a noble house, chass' bench was in the inner circle, just above the legislator's dais. vox/pict drones mumbled and hovered along the benches like bumblebees. the legislature choir, told to shut up some minutes before by noble croe, sat sullenly in their balcony, balling up pages of sheet music and throwing them down on the assembly beneath. master jehnik, of house ordinary jehnik, was on his feet in the middle circle, reading from a prepared slate and trying to get someone to listen to his fifty-five-point plan. chass pressed the geno-reader on the side of his hardwood stall and the plate slid open before him. he keyed in his authority rating, touched the statement nines and wrote: master legislator, are we going to debate or simply argue all night? the words flashed up on the central plate and six other noble houses, fifteen houses ordinary and the majority of the guild associations assented. silence fell. the master legislator, anophy, an ancient hunchback with a tricorn, ribboned hat, crawled to his feet from his dais throne and began the litany of enfranchisement. the assembly was quiet as it was intoned. anophy stroked his long, silver moustache, smoothed the front of his opalescent robe and asked the assembly for points of order. around seventy holographic runes lit the plate display and glowed overhead via hovering repeater screens. commotion, louder than before. several nobles and many guilders thumped their assent sirens vigorously. chass rose. sympathetic holograms flashed sycophantically from the tiers of some of the houses ordinary. chass continued. now the roaring grew. assent sigils lit up all around. how would you wish me answer that? soric paused, leaned awkwardly on his crutch, and wiped the ash from his supervisor's badge with a hawk of spit. he held it up so the uniformed man could see. as should you. bellowed a worker beside soric. ozmac, probably, but it was impossible to tell under the soot. other workers jeered and agreed. before any of the troopers could react, the workers were on them like a tidal wave. all of the troopers were killed in a few seconds. the smeltery workers gathered up their weapons. worker gannif handed the commissar's pistol to soric. soric barked. he waved for them to follow him down the transit channel. the hall had remained silent as the high master's floating throne ascended to the main dais with its stone-faced vphc vanguard. sondar's throne had locked into place above the high legislator's dais and the master of vervunhive had spent a long moment looking out at the assembly before speaking. sondar's masked visage turned to look around at the vast swoop of the tiered hall. still the nervous silence. chass watched the high lord's movements and saw how jerky they were. it's not him, he thought. the wretch has sent another servitor puppet to represent him. the assembly looked down at the benches where the officials of the administratum sat. hooded and gowned, intendant banefail of the imperial administratum got to his feet. but with the crowds this thick, she didn't know if it was going to be possible. maybe they'd be safer in the city, under the shield. the baby began to cry. he couldn't breathe. the weight and blackness upon him were colossal. something oily was dripping into his eyes. he tried to move, but no movement was possible. no, that wasn't true. he could grind his toes in his army boots. his mouth was full of rockcrete dust. he started to cough and found his lungs had no room to move. he was squashed. there was a rattling, chinking sound above him. he could hear voices, distant and muffled. he tried to cry out, but the dust choked him and he had no room to choke. light. a chink of light, just above as rubble was moved away. rubble moved and some pieces slumped heavier on him, vicing his legs and pelvis. there was a face in the gap above him. bodyguard! to me! menx! troor! my friends! fetch yourselves a drink from the cart and relax! your master is proud of you! kowle snapped. �general noches sturm, after his victory on grimoyr the bombardment continued, both day and night, for two and a half weeks. by the close of the twelfth day, day and night were barely distinguishable, so great was the atmospheric smoke-haze hanging around vervunhive. the shield held firm, but the southern outhabs and manufactories became a fire-blown wasteland, fifty kilometres square. some shelling had also been deliberately ranged over the shield, catastrophically wounding the unprotected northern districts and large sections of the hass docklands. on the afternoon of the sixth day, marshal edric croe, the legislature's appointed successor to gnide, ordered the closing of the southern hive gates. the new marshal, brother of lord croe of that noble house, had been a serving major-colonel in vervun primary and his election was ratified by seven of the nine noble houses. noble house anko � who were sponsoring their own general, heskith anko, for the post � voted to deny. noble house chass abstained. marshal croe was a pale, white-haired giant, well over two metres tall. his fierce black eyes and hard gaze were the subject of barrack legend, but he was personally calm, quiet and inspirational, judicious in leadership and popular with the men. the majority vote of the noble houses reflected their confidence in him � and the fact they felt he would remain answerable to them in all circumstances. heskith anko, a plump, swarthy brute who approached war politically rather than tactically, was appointed croe's chief of staff to appease house anko. the two did not get on and their furious arguments in house command became notorious. croe's decision to close the gates � at this stage there were still some half a million refugees streaming in from the southern districts seeking sanctuary at hass west, sondar and croe gates �surprised the houses and the legislature as a whole. many believed croe had bowed to anko's persistent pressure. house chass, house rodyin and seven houses ordinary raised a bill of disapproval and railed against the cruelty of the action. half a million, left to die, the gates sealed against them. in fact, marshal croe's decision had been far more deeply affected by the advice of commissar kowle, who had returned from the frontline with the tattered remnants of the tank divisions on the second night. despite the losses suffered by vegolain's forces, kowle was hailed by many as a hero. he had single-handedly rallied more than thirty vehicles and crews and pulled them back, bringing first-hand details of the enemy home to the hive. the publicaddress plates spoke freely of his heroism and loyalty. his name was chanted in the refugee camps and in all gatherings of citizens and workers. it was popularly believed he would be decorated for his actions and many in the low classes saw him as a folk hero and a �better choice for marshal than croe. when, on the ninth day, food, water and energy rationing was imposed hive-wide by the legislature, a speech by kowle was published on the address plates, stating how he would not only be observing rationing strictly, but also rationing his rations. croe realised quickly that he should not underestimate kowle's power as a popular figure. but that also meant he couldn't ignore kowle's tactical suggestions out of hand. croe, anko and the assembled officer elite spent most of the fifth day in conference. they filled the briefing hall of house command in the main spine to capacity. an expectant hush fell on the assembled soldiers when croe asked kowle to give his assessment of the opposition. kowle rose to his feet, the shrapnel wound in his forehead clearly and crudely sutured (another carefully judged move on kowle's part). eighty or ninety thousand armoured vehicles, thousands of gun batteries and an infantry force behind them of several million. but i am sure, by disposition alone, that at least five million troops were embarked in file behind the armour advance. there was hubbub and murmuring in the officer ranks.  croe had requested orbital pictures prior to the meeting, pictures he had hoped would confirm or deny these outlandish claims. but the smoke patterns from the continued bombardment were blanketing the continent and nothing was discernible. he had to trust kowle's estimation, an estimation supported by many of the armour crews he had brought back with him. croe also had to consider the political and popular suicide of contradicting the people's hero. croe was silent. his gate officers had brought him updates on the refugee intake, the miserable statistics of the dispossessed and wounded still pressing for entry after five days. but kowle's assessment was inarguable. while the magnitude of this decision soaked into the stunned officers, colonel modile requested that the wall artillery be raised and armed. at the first alarm, the rampart defences had been manned and raised, but more potent heavy guns, dormant since the trade war, were still muzzled in deployment silos in the curtain wall itself. vice marshal anko reported that this work was already underway. the hive's main firepower would be ready in two more days and at last the city would have long range artillery to answer the bombardment. asked commissar tarrian, head of the vphc. croe smiled. but that is still nine days away. we must be strong, we must be fast, we must be secure well before then. the south gates close at nine tomorrow. such was the size of the northcol deployment and such was the capacity of the ferries that estimates suggested it would take four days to cross them over the hass into vervunhive. when told of this, marshal croe ordered the hass viaduct reopened so that rail links could resume. the rail route had been closed at the start of the bombardment. bypassing the ferry route, northcol got its forces into the hive in just under two days. many tanks and armoured personnel carriers actually crossed the viaduct under their own power, trundling along the rail tracks. two divisions of the northcol infantry also marched across the viaduct in a break between trains. so far, nothing had been heard of the promised reinforcements from vannick hive, the great refinery collective three thousand kilometres away to the east. vannick had undertaken to provide nine regiments, but thus far the only thing that had come from them was the continued fuel-oil supplies carried by the eastern pipeline. many in vervunhive wondered if the forces of zoica had reached them too. * * * at dawn on the fourteenth day, lights were seen in the upper atmosphere. flaring their braking jets , imperial guard dropships descended, diverted to the main lift-port at kannak in the northern collective hives. with the shield erected, vervunhive's central landing field could accept no ships. the imperial guard disembarked at kannak and then marched south on the tail of the northcol forces. the simple sight of their high-orbit adjustments and blazing descents lifted the morale of the battered hive. the guard was coming. the royal volpone 1st, 2nd and 4th deployed south from kannak port swiftly, using the rail link to bring themselves deep into the hive. marshal croe personally greeted general noches sturm, the decorated victor of grimoyr, on the rockcrete platform of the north spine terminus.  a large crowd of politically approved citizens cheered them, under the watchful eyes of the vphc. dressed in shimmering blue gowns, daughters of the noble houses � merity chass, alina anko, iona gavunda and murdith croe amongst them � were sent forward to decorate sturm and his second officers, colonels gilbear and corday, with silk floral wreathes. sturm was also greeted by the famous commissar kowle. the image of their smiling handshake was repeated on a million public-address plates across the hive. the 5th and 7th regiments of the roane deepers, under general nash, arrived by rail later that afternoon, amid more pantomime celebrations. vice marshal anko was there to greet nash and brass bands pomped and trumpeted the arrival. amid the jubilation, nash was able to confirm that three full regiments of narmenian armour were offloading from carriers at the kannak port landing fields and would be en route south by dawn. the crowd rose, cheering the news, hailing the honoured guard arrivals like they had already won the war. the tanith first-and-only arrived by road, almost unnoticed, two nights later. more than eighty matt-black troop trucks rumbled down the northcol highway through the northern outhabs of vervunhive. the canvas tilts had been removed and around thirty tanith troopers rode in each, crouched down with their weapons, webbing, haversacks, musette bags and bedrolls gathered to them. the bouncing trucks � sixwheelers with large, snarling front grills and pop-eye headlamps � bore the quadruple chevron cab-marks of northcol utility transport division three. jerry cans and spare wheels were slung to their sides on sponson fittings. a dozen outriders astride black-drab motorcycles ran along their flanks, and behind the main column came thirty more high-cabbed eight-wheelers laden with ammunition crates and regimental supplies, as well as the numerous cooks, armourers, mechanics, servitors and other attendant hangers-on that followed a guard regiment on the move. these freighters were dull yellow, the livery of the kannak port cargo union, and netting was draped over their payloads. northcol soldiers in pale blue overalls and forage caps drove all the trucks, but the outriders were tanith, in their distinctive dark battledress. twelve kilometres short of vervunhive, they paused to trickle through a checkpoint on the highway and they gained a vanguard of two dark-blue staff cars crewed by vphc officers to lead them in. all the headlamps in the convoy were blazing. night had fallen sometime, unnoticed in the thick wallow of smoke. the only sights were the battered districts to either side, the fuzzy green glow of the hive itself � partly obscured by the smoke � and the occasional flash and flare of long-range shells falling into the outer habs they raced through. brin milo, the youngest ghost, rode with the rest of number one platoon in the lead truck. a slender, pale youth just now filling out with adult bulk, he had been the only non-soldier saved from the ruins of tanith when their homeworld was overrun and destroyed four years earlier. the commissar himself had saved his life and dragged him from the fires that burned tanith away. but six months before, during the battle for monthax, he had finally become a soldier too. he was proud of his issued equipment and lasgun, and he kept his pack in better order than any of the seasoned tanith troopers. brin looked up at trooper larkin opposite him. a wiry, taut-skinned man in his early fifties, larkin was as wellknown for his neurotic personality as his skill as the regiment's most able sniper. the long, specialised shape of his marksman's lasgun was sheathed in a canvas roll at his feet. larkin had produced his gun-scope and was training it like a spyglass out of the truck. corbec tossed back at the grinning soldier. milo held the scope up to corbec, who waved it off with disinterest. in the juddering load-bay of the truck three vehicles back, third platoon were all wagering on cards. trooper feygor, a dangerous, lean man with hooded eyes, had bartered a full tarot pack from some administratum fellow on the troopship and he was running a game of hearts and titans. trooper brostin, big, heavyset and saturnine, had lost so much already he was ready to wager his flamer, with the fuel tanks, as his next lay-down. feygor, a thick cigar clenched between his sharp teeth, laughed at brostin's discomfiture and shuffled the pack again. as he flicked the big pasteboard cards out into hands around the grilled deck, the men of the platoon produced coins, crumpled notes, rings and tobacco rations to add to the pot. trooper caffran watched him deal. short, young and determined, just a year older than milo, caffran had gained the respect of them all during the beach assault at oskray about a year before. caffran disliked cards, but in rawne's platoon it paid to mix in. major rawne sat at the end of the truck-bay, his back to the rear wall of the cab. the tanith second officer, he was infamous for his anger, guile and pessimism. feygor asked, his hands hesitating on the deal. rawne shook his head. he'd lost plenty to his adjutant in the last forty days of transit in the troopship. now he could smell war and idle gaming had lost its interest. feygor shrugged and finished the deal. caffran picked up his hand and sighed. brostin picked up his hand and sighed more deeply. he wondered if wool socks would count as a wager. the outriders raced around the speeding trucks, gunning for the destination.  sergeant mkoll, head of the scout platoon, crossed his bike in between two of the troop vehicles and rode down the edge-gully so he could take a look at the hive emerging out of the smoke before them. it was big, bigger than any city he'd ever seen, bigger than the bastion towns of tanith certainly. he roared ahead, passing the staff cars of the local commissariat, until he was leading the column down the broken highway towards the docks. a volley of shells fell into the outhabs to the east. dorden, the grizzled, elderly chief medic of the tanith regiment, heaved himself up to see. conflagrations, bright and bitter-lemon in colour, sizzled out from the distant detonations. the truck sashayed into a pothole and dorden was dropped on his arse. say again? well, okay� it's got sacra in it. when varl tried another, he was told to shut up, to his face. sergeant varl handled people better than most of the officers in the regiment and he knew when to reprimand and when to back off. he'd been a dog-soldier himself for long enough. but the mood in his platoon was bad. and varl knew why. no one wanted this. no one wanted to get in the middle of a hive-war. the magnificat was waiting at the northern docks as the column rolled in out of the firelit night. all the hass ferries were working full-stretch to keep the river open and convoy after convoy of military supplies and ammunition were arriving each hour from the northern collectives. troops from vervun primary � in blue greatcoats, grey webbing and the distinctive spiked helmets � along with vphc men, servitors and a good few red-robed clerks and overseers from the administratum were now controlling the river freight, much to the fury of the regular longshoremen of the dockmaster guild. ecclesiarchy priests had also arrived on the third or fourth day, establishing a permanent prayer-vigil to protect the crossing and make the waterway and the viaduct safe. the hooded clergy were grouped around a brazier at a pier end, chanting and intoning. they were there each time folik drew the magnificat back to the northshore wharves. it seemed they never slept, never rested. he got into the habit of nodding to them every time he slid the ferry in past them. they never responded. on this night run, folik expected to take on more supply vehicles and crates, but the house troopers running the dockside had drawn the north-col freight trucks aside so that troop transports could move round them and roll down the landing stages. folik nursed the ancient turbines into station-keeping as mincer dropped the ramp. the first two trucks growled and bounced aboard. mincer directed them to their deck spaces with a pair of dagger-lamps. a tall, long-coated figure dropped from the cab of the first truck. he approached longshoreman folik. folik was almost hypnotised by the commissar badge on the peaked cap. at the rail, colonel-commissar ibram gaunt gazed out from the deck of the magnificat and smiled as he overheard the words. the magnificat was in mid-stream when the eastern sky lit up brightly. there was a sucking shudder, like a windrush over the water. the eastern horizon blazed with a midnight sun. mincer cried. a commotion rose from the troops. gaunt raised his hand to shield his eyes from the glare as a heat-wash rolled down the river. he knew the blasteffects of a nuclear detonation when he saw it. �marshal edric croe, on hearing the news from vannick kowle went directly to house command when the news was voxed to him. he had been touring the south curtain and it took him almost an hour to cross the hive back to the main spine. the control auditorium was a chaotic mess. munitorum clerks, regimental aides and other junior personnel hurried about, gabbling, panicking, relaying reports from the operators manning the main tactical cogitators banked around the lower level of the large, circular chamber. many vervun primary officers and even some vphc troops were clogging the place too, anxious to find out if the rumours were true. kowle pushed past the onlookers at the chamber door and sent many back to their stations with curt words. none argued. they saluted and backed off from him quickly. he crossed the wide floor and then hurried up the ironwork staircase onto the upper deck of the auditorium, where the chiefs of staff were gathered around the vast, luminous chart table. junior aides and technicians, many bearing important vox reports, made way for him without question. marshal croe presided over the group at the chart table. his eyes were blacker than ever and he had removed his cap, as if the weight of it was too much now. his personal bodyguard, isak, dressed in an armoured maroon bodyglove and carrying a shrouded gun, hovered at his shoulder. vice marshal anko, wearing a medal-heavy white ceremonial uniform, stood glowering nearby. he had been attending a formal dinner thrown by house anko to welcome the volpone. sturm and his aides stood alongside him, clad in the impressive dress uniforms of the volpone.  also present were xance of northcol � looking tired and drawn, along with several of his senior staff � the narmenian grizmund and his tank brigadiers, nash of the roane deepers and his adjutants, and a dozen more senior vervun primary officers, as well as commissar tarrian of the vphc. kowle asked, removing his cap but making no other formal salute. croe nodded, but remained silent. a calm voice asked from the head of the stairs. the tall newcomer wore a commissar's cap and a long, black leather coat. he stepped towards them. his clothing was still flecked with dust from his journey. tarrian murmured back. gaunt stepped up to the chart table, pulling off his gloves and studying the display. their forces had served alongside each other on monthax and there was a genuine, mutual admiration. he shook the general's hand firmly. gaunt smiled to himself. the last time he had met sturm in person, back on voltemand, the pompous ass had been threatening him with court martial. gaunt had not forgotten that sturm's callous leadership had resulted in heavy losses in the ghost ranks from friendly artillery. you're only putting on this show of comradeship so you can look good in the eyes of the local grandees, gaunt thought, returning sturm's gaze with unblinking directness. you are an unspeakable wretch and i regret this place has the likes of you to look after it. but gaunt was a political animal as well as a combat leader, and he knew how to play this game as well as any runt general. kowle stepped forward to face gaunt. � various voices rose in anger, but gaunt's words cut them to quiet. again it comes back to this question! invasion, conquest � i can understand those things! but to destroy what you have fought to take? � warmaster slaydo, from a treatise on the nature of warfare a party of local troops in blue greatcoats waited for them at the entrance to a dingy shed complex, under the starkwhite light of sodium lamps. their weapons were slung over their shoulders and they wore woollen caps, their spiked helmets dangling from their webbing. they flashed the convoy in through the chain-link gate with daggerlamps. sergeant mkoll was first into the compound, slewing up his motorbike on the greasy rockcrete skirt and heeling down the kickstand. the heavy machine leaned to the left and rested, its throaty purr cutting off. mkoll dismounted as the tanith troop trucks thundered into the yard after him. mkoll looked at the manufactory sheds around them.  this was a dismal place, but the tanith had billeted in worse. said the figure approaching behind him. he was a tall, well-made man in his twenties, dressed in the local uniform. a captain, his collar pins said. his right arm was bound up tight to his chest in a padded sling, so he wore his greatcoat on one side only, draping it like a cape over the other. mkoll thought he was lucky that empty sleeve was not a permanent feature. captain ban daur, vervun primary. welcome to vervunhive. a voice ordered crisply behind him. corbec turned and for a moment he thought it was gaunt. but only for a moment. the commissar stalking towards him had nothing of gaunt's presence. he had local insignia and his puffy face was pale and unhealthy. corbec said nothing but simply took the cigar from his mouth and raised one eyebrow. he was a good twenty-five centimetres taller than the black-coated officer. corbec put the cigar back between his lips and, still silent, tapped the colonel's rank pins on his shoulder braid. daur glanced around at the mouldering sheds where the tanith first were breaking out their kits and lighting lamps in neat platoon order. corbec chuckled. corbec nodded. lousy chem plant barns for the tanith ghosts. he was prepared to bet a month's pay the volpone bluebloods weren't bedding down in some sooty hangar this night. so far, the main water supplies are still on, so the showers work. corbec looked where daur indicated and saw a row of tanker trucks with fuel clamps and standpipes grouped by the western fence. corbec gazed across at the rickety long-shed daur pointed to. mkoll flagged down a passing trooper and sent him off to find the chief medic. the rooms were thick with dust and cobwebs, but two deep-gain vox units were mounted on scrubbed benches along one wall, flickering and active, chattering with staccato dribbles of link-talk.  there were even fresh paper rolls and lead-sticks laid out near the sets. the thoroughness made corbec smile. maybe it was the worker-mentality of the hive. he showed corbec a side office with a cot and a folding desk. corbec glanced in, nodded and turned back to face the captain. raise a detail and get our stuff housed from the trucks. daur asked. a thin, hangdog man, lesp was skulking to one side in the doorway with chayker and foskin. the three of them represented dorden's medical orderlies, troopers who had been trained for field hospital work by the chief medic himself. lesp shrugged. the orderlies behind him tried to cover their sniggers. gherran and mtane laughed out loud. langana spat. anger made his cheeks florid. langana was about to retort when a strong, female voice echoed through the dirty space. she frowned at him briefly. his use of her forename surprised her. such informalities were rare in the hive. it was discourteous, almost condescending. she'd worked for her status and position as hard as any other hiver. dorden looked round at the woman, surprised, clearly hurt that he had offended her in any way. behind dorden, langana smiled. well, as you can see, this is no place for wounded. can you possibly� assist us? oh, yes i can, commissar! fifth bill of rights, amendment 457/hj: �in event of conflict, surgeon staff may commandeer all available resources for the furtherance of competent medical work.' i want scrub teams from the hive sanitation department here by morning, with pressure hoses and steam scourers. i want disinfectant sluices. langana hesitated. dorden looked on. he liked her already. the commissar saluted briefly and then marched away out of the chamber. he had to push through the smirking tanith orderlies to exit. dorden turned to the woman. dorden fixed her with an honest smile. she seemed about to soften and smile back, but she turned and led her team away out of the door. varl supervised the store detail, carrying more than his share thanks to the power of his artificial arm. with a team of thirty, he ordered the stacking and layout of the tanith supplies. there was plenty of stuff in the barn already, well marked and identified by the triplicate manifest data-slates, but there was still more than enough room for the supplies and munitions they had brought with them. another truck backed up to the doorway, lights winking, and domor, cocoer and brostin helped to shift the crates of perishables to their appointed stacks. varl allocated another area for the munitions he had been told would arrive later. caffran looked up as the sergeant called to him. make sure the rear of the barn is secure. he called. the child and the girl looked round at him sharply, like animals caught in a huntsman's light. caffran saw for just a moment the strong, fierce, beautiful face of the girl before the children ducked out of sight and vanished into the wasteland. he ran up the slope after them, but they were gone. she took out the biscuits and tore the wrap open so he could have one. dalin wolfed it down. he was hungry. they were all hungry out here. nutrient clouds pumped into the iron tank fed the dreaming high master of vervunhive. he rolled in his oily fluid womb, pulling at his link feeds, feet and hands twitching like a dreaming dog. he dreamed of the trade war, before his birth. the images of his dream were informed by the pict-library he had studied in his youth. he dreamed of his illustrious predecessor, the great heironymo, haughtily spurning the rivalry with ferrozoica, arming for war. how wrong, how very foolish! such a grossly physical stubbornness! and the hive held him in such esteem for his heroic leadership! fools! cattle! unthinking chaff! commerce is always war. but the war of commerce may be fought in such subtle, exquisite ways. to raise arms, to mobilise bodies, to turn beautiful hive profits into war machines and guns, rations and ammunition� what a pathetic mind, heironymo! how blind of you to miss the real avenues of victory! house clatch would have bowed to mercantile embargoes long before the brave boys of vervun primary had overturned the walls of zoica! a concession here, a bargain there, a stifling of funds or supplies, a blockade� salvador sondar floated upwards, his dreams now machine-language landscapes of autoledgers, contoured ziggurats of mounted interest values, rivers of exchange rates, terraces of production value outputs. the mathematical vistas of mercantile triumph he adored more than any other place in the universe. he twitched again in the warm soup, iridescent bubbles coating his shrunken limbs and fluttering to the roof of the iron tank. he was pleased now that he had killed the old man. heironymo had ruled too long! a hundred and twenty years old, beloved by the stupid, vapid public, still unwilling to make way for his twenty year-old nephew and obvious successor! it had been a merciful act, salvador dreamed to himself, though the guilt of it had plagued him for the last fifty years. his sleeping features winced. yes, it had been merciful� for the good of the hive and for the further prosperity of house sondar, noble line! had output not tripled during his reign? and now gnide and croe and chass and the other weaklings told him that mercantile war was no longer an option! fools! gnide � now� he was dead, wasn't he? and slaydo too? the great warmaster, dead of poison. no, that wasn't right. stabbed on the carpet of the audience hall � no� no� why were his dreams so confused? it was the chatter. that was it. the chatter. he wished it would cease. it was a hindrance to reason. he was high master of vervunhive and he wanted his dream-mind dean and unpolluted so he could command his vast community to victory once more. the shield? what? what about the shield? the chatter was lisping something. no ! n-n� salvador sondar's dreams were suddenly as suspended as the dreamer for a moment. fugue state snarled his dream-mind. he floated in the tank as if dead. then the dreams resumed in a rush. to poison the servitor taster, that had been a stroke of genius! no one had ever suspected! and to use a neural toxin that left no trace. a stroke, they had said! a stroke had finally levelled old heironymo! salvador had been forced to inject his own tear glands with saline to make himself cry at the state funeral. the weeping! the mass mourning! fifty years ago, but still it gnawed at him! why had the hivers loved the old bastard so dearly? the chatter was there again, at the very boundary of his mind-impulse limit, like crows in a distant treeline at dawn, like insects in the grasslands at dusk. chattering� the shield? what are you saying about the shield? i am salvador sondar. get out of my mind and� the wasted body twitched and spasmed in the iron tank. outside, the servitors jiggled and jerked in sympathy. the vast railhead terminal at veyveyr gate was a dank, blackened mess. clouds of steam rolled like fog off the cooling rubble and tangled metal where millions of litres of fluid retardant had been sprayed on the incendiary fires to get them under control. major jun racine of the vervun primary moved between the struggling work teams and tried to supervise the clearance work. tried� it was a joke. he had two hundred bodies, mostly enlisted men, but some administratum labourers, as well as trackwrights and rolling-stock stewards from the rail guild. it was barely enough even to make a dent in destruction of this scale. racine was no structural engineer.  even with fourteen heavy tractors fitted with dozer blades at his disposal, there was no way he was going to meet house command's orders and get the railhead secure in three days. great roof sections had slumped like collapsed egg-shell, and rockcrete pillars had crumpled and folded like soft candy-sticks. he was reluctant to instruct his men to dig out anything for fear of bringing more down. already he had sent five men to the medical halls after a section of wall had toppled on them. the air was wet and acrid, and water dripped down from every surface, pooling five centimetres deep on any open flooring. racine checked his data-slate again. the cold, basic schematics on its screen simply didn't match anything here in real life. he couldn't even locate the positions of the main power and gas-feed mains. nearby, a rail tractor unit sat up-ended in a vast crater, its piston wheels dangling off its great black iron shape. what if fuel had leaked from it? racine thought about leaked fuel, shorting electrics, spilling gas � even unexploded bombs � an awful lot. racine turned. the speaker was a short, bulky man in his fifties, black with grime and leaning on an axe-rack as a crutch. he had a serious eye-wound bandaged with a filthy strip of linen. but his clothes, as far as racine could make out under the char and the dirt, were those of a smeltery gang boss. he stood beside racine and they both gazed dismally out over the tangled ruins of the railhead towards the vast, looming shape of the gate and the curtain wall. it was a sea of rubble and debris, and racine's workforce moved like ants around the merest breakwaters of it. soric made a brief gesture over at the vast, ruined shell of the once-proud ore plant adjacent to the railhead. supplies are short: food, clean water, medical aid. racine shivered. soric smiled. he tucked the axe-rack crutch under his armpit so he could extend a dirty hand. the chronometer's chime told him it was dawn, but even up here in the mid spine, there was little change in the light outside. the glow of the shield and the smoke haze saw to that. amchanduste worlin took breakfast in the observation bubble of his clan's palace. he had risen earlier than any of his kin, though junior guild worlin clerics and servitors were already about, preparing the day's work protocols. in orange-silk night robes, he sat in a suspensor chair at the round mahogany table and consumed the breakfast his servants had brought him on a lacquered tray. the taster servitor had pronounced it safe and been dismissed. worlin's attention oscillated between the panoramic view of the city outside and the data-plate built into the table top where the morning news and situation bulletins threaded and interwove in clusters of glowing runes. an egg souffl�, smoked fish, fresh fruit, toasted wheatcakes and a jug of caffeine. not recommended emergency rations, worlin knew, but what was the point of being a member of the privileged merchant elite if you couldn't draw on the stockpiles of your clan's resources once in a while? he improved the caffeine with a shot of joiliq. worlin felt a measure of contentment for the first time in days and it wasn't just the alcohol. there was one holding owned by house worlin, one under his direct control, that gave them commercial leverage in this war: liquid fuel. he had quite forgotten it in his initial dismay and panic. last season, he had won the fuel concession from guild farnora, much to his clan's delight. thirty percent of the fuel imports from vannick hive, three whole pipelines, were under the direct control of guild worlin. he looked at the megalitre input figures on his data-slate, then made a few calculations as to how the market price per barrel would soar exponentially with each day of conflict. magnal paused. magnal tried to show a data slate to worlin, but the guilder shrugged it away diffidently. the flow may only last another day, another few hours. but if i close now, can you imagine the lost profits? not good business, my friend. magnal looked uncomfortable. it hit the saucer a little too hard, making magnal jump, though the kindly smile never left worlin's face. worlin sat for a while, tapping his silver sugar tongs on the edge of his saucer. there was no doubt about it. he would have to kill magnal too. at the very southernmost edge of the outer habs and industry sectors, the great hive was a sky-filling dome of green light, pale in the morning sun, hazed by shell smoke. captain olin fencer of vervun primary crawled from his dug-out and blinked into the cold morning air. that air was still thick with the mingled reeks of thermite and fycelene, burning fuel and burned flesh. but there was something different about this morning. he couldn't quite work out what it was. fencer's squad of fifty troopers had been stationed at outhab southwest when the whole thing began. vox links had been lost in the first wave of shelling and they had been able to do nothing but dig in and ride it out, as day after day of systematic bombardment flattened and ruptured the industrial outer city behind them. there was no chance to retreat back into the hive, though fencer knew millions of habbers in the district had fled that way. he had a post to hold. he was stationed at it with the thirty-three men remaining to him when vegolain's armoured column had rolled past down the southern highway, out into the grasslands. his squad had cheered them. they'd been hiding in their bunkers, some weeping in rage or pain or dismay, that night when the broken remnants of the column had limped back in, heading for the city. by then, he had twenty men left. in the days that followed, fencer had issued his own orders by necessity, as all links to house command were broken. indeed, he was sure no one in the hive believed there was anyone still alive out here. he had followed the edicts of the vervun primary emergency combat protocols to the letter, organising the digging of a series of trenches, supply lines and fortifications through the ruins of the outhabs, though the shelling still fell on them. his first sergeant, grosslyn, had mined the roadways and other teams had dug tank-traps and dead-snares. despite the shelling, they had also raised a three hundred-metre bulwark of earth, filled an advance ditch with iron stakes and railing sections, and sandbagged three stubbers and two flamers into positions along the highway. all by the tenth day. by then, he had eighteen soldiers left. three more had died of wounds or disease by the fourteenth day, when the high-orbit flares of troopships told them guard reinforcements were on their way planetside. now it was sunrise on the nineteenth day. plastered in dust and blood, fencer moved down the main trench position as his soldiers woke or took over guard duty from the weary night sentries. but now he had sixty troops. main spine thought everything was levelled out here, everything dead, but they were wrong. not everyone on the blasted outer habs had fled to the hive, though it must have seemed that way. many stayed, too unwilling, too stubborn, or simply too frightened to move. as the days of bombardment continued, fencer found men and women � and some children too � flocking to him from the ruins. he got the non-coms into any bunkers he had available and he set careful rationing. all able-bodied workers, of either sex, he recruited into his vanguard battalion. they'd raised precious medical supplies from the infirmary unit of a bombed-out mine and they'd set up a field hospital in the ruins of a bakery, under the supervision of a teenage girl called nessa who was a trainee nurse. they'd pilfered food supplies in the canteens of three ruined manufactories in the region. a vphc guard house on west transit 567/kl had provided them with a stock of lasguns and small arms for the new recruits, as well as explosives and one of the flamers. fencer's recruits had come from everywhere. he had under his command clerks who'd never held a weapon, loom workers with poor eyesight and shell-shocked habbers who were deaf and could only take orders visually. the core of his recruits, the best of them, were twenty-one miners from number seventeen deep working, who had literally dug their way out of the ground after the main lift shaft of their facility had fallen. fencer bent low and hurried down the trench line, passing through blown-out house structures, under fallen derricks, along short communication tunnels the miners had dug to link his defences. their expertise had been a godsend. he reached the second stub emplacement at 567/kk and nodded to the crew. corporal gannen was making soup in his mess tin over a burner stove, while his crewmate, a loom-girl called calie, scanned the horizon. they were a perfect example of the way necessity had made heroes of them all. gannen was a trained stub-gunner, but better at ammo feeding than firing. the girl had proven to be a natural at handling the gun itself. so they swapped, the corporal conceding no pride that he now fed ammo to a loom-girl half his age. fencer moved on, passing two more guard points and found gol kolea in the corner nest, overlooking the highway. kolea, the natural leader of the miners, was a big man, with great power in his upper body. he was sipping hot water from a battered tin cup, his lasgun at his side. fencer intended to give him a brevet rank soon. the man had earned it. he had led his miners out of the dark, formed them into a cohesive work duty and done everything fencer could have asked of them. and more besides. kolea was driven by grim, intense fury against the zoican foe. he had family in the hive, though he didn't speak of them. the powerfully built miner grinned at him. it had been so much a part of their daily life for the last fortnight or more, he hadn't realised it had gone. indeed, his ears were still ringing with remembered shockwaves. he gasped. fencer was about to reach for his scope when zoica began its land offensive. a wave of las-fire peppered the entire defence line of the outhabs, like the flashes of a billion firecrackers. the sheer scale of the salvos was bewildering.  nine of fencer's troops died instantly. three more, all workers, fled, utterly unprepared for the fury of a land assault. grenades and rockets dropped in around them, blowing out two communication dug-outs. another hit the mess hall and torched their precious food supplies. fencer's people began their resistance. he'd ordered them all to set weapons for single fire to preserve ammunition and power cells. even the stubbers had been ordered only to fire if they had a target. in response to the zoican assault, their return seemed meagre and frail. fencer got up to the nest top and raised his lasgun. five hundred metres ahead, through the smoke and the rubble, he saw the first shapes of the enemy, troopers in heavy, ochre-coloured battledress, advancing in steady ranks. fencer began firing. below, kolea opened up too. they took thirteen down between them in the first five minutes. zoican tanks, mottled ochre and growling like beasts, bellied up the road and fanned out into the ruins, using the available open roadways and other aisles in the rubble sea. mines took two of them out in huge vomits of flame and armour pieces, and the burning hulks blocked the advance of six more. rockets flailed into the bulwark and blew a fifteen-metre section out. corporal tanik and three other troops were disintegrated. another zoican tank, covered with mesh netting, rumbled through the ruins and diverted down a dead-snare. blocked in by rockcrete walls to either side and ahead , it tried to reverse and swing its turret as one of the vervun flamer positions washed it with incandescent gusts of blowtorch fire and cooked it apart. sergeant grosslyn, with two vervun primary regulars and six enlisted habbers, cut a crossfire down at zoican troops trying to scramble a staked ditch on the eastern end of the file. between them, they killed fifty or more, many impaled on the railings and wire. when jada, the female worker next to him, was hit in the chest and dropped, screaming, grosslyn turned to try and help her. a las-round from one of the dying zoican assault troops impaled on the stakes took the back of his head off. gannen and calie held the west transit for two hours, taking out dozens of the enemy and at least one armoured vehicle which ruptured and blew out as the loom-girl raked it with armour-piercing stub rounds. gannen was torn apart by shrapnel from a rocket when the enemy pushed around to the left. calie kept firing, feeding her own gun until a tank round blew her, her stub gun and twenty metres of the defence bulwark into the sky. overwhelmed, fencer's force fell back into the ruins of the outhab. some were crushed by the advancing armour. one enlisted clerk, dying of blood-loss from a boltwound, made a suicide run with a belt of grenades and took out a stationary tank. the explosion lit up the low clouds and scraps of tank metal rained down over the surrounding streets. others fought a last-ditch attempt as the sheer numbers of the advancing infantry overran them. there were insane pockets of close fighting, bayonet to bayonet, hand to hand. not a metre of vervunhive's outhab territory was given up without the most horrific effort. gol kolea, his las weapon exhausted, met the enemy at the barricade and killed them one by one, to left and right, with savage swings of his axe-rake. he screamed his wife's name with every blow. a las-round punctured captain olin fencer's body at the hip and exited through his opposite shoulder. as he fell, weeping, he clicked his lasgun to autofire and sprayed his massing killers with laser rounds. his hand was still squeezing the trigger when the pack ran out. by then, he was already dead. �sebastian thor, sermons, vol. xv, ch. div gaunt felt the monumental bulk of the curtain wall around him actually vibrate. the shellfire falling against its outer skin was a dull roar. captain daur and three other officers of the liaison staff led the oversight party up the stair-drum of a secondary tower in the wall just west of the massive heironymo sondar gate. gaunt had brought rawne and mkoll, with trooper milo as his adjutant. general grizmund � with three of his senior narmenians � and general nash � with two of his regimental aides � made up the rest of the party, along with tarrian of the vphc. they had a bodyguard detail of thirty vervun primary troopers in full battledress. the oversight party emerged onto the tower-top, where hot breezes, stifling with fycelene fumes, billowed over them. three missile launchers were raised and ready here, their crews standing by, but additional awnings of flakboard had been erected in preparation for the visit of the dignitaries, and the launchers, with no safe room for their exhaust wash under this extra shelter, had fallen silent. the crews saluted the visitors smartly. tarrian frowned. tarrian looked round at nash and grizmund. the narmenian nodded briefly. tarrian turned from the group and began issuing orders to the launcher crews. the rest of the oversight party approached the rampart and took up magnoculars or used the available viewscopes on their tripod stands. milo handed gaunt his own scope from its pouch and the commissar dialled the magnification as he raised it and gazed out. below them, the miserable wasteland of the southern outer habs lay exposed and broken. there was no discernible sign of life, but a hateful storm of enemy shelling and missiles pounded in across it at the hive. a fair amount fell short into the habs, but a good percentage struck the curtain wall itself. gaunt craned over for a moment, training his scope down the gentle slope of the wall. its adamantine surface was peppered and scarred like the face of a moon, as far as he could see. every few seconds, batteries to either side of them on the wall fired out, or the great siege guns in the emplacements below in the thickness of the wall recoiled and volleyed again. the vibration of the wall continued. as we have been told, this is no longer the work of their long-range artillery out in the grasslands. gaunt watched for flashes through his scope. like nash, he was an infantry commander, and he always appreciated technical insight from experienced officers with expertise in other schools of warfare. grizmund had a fine reputation as an armour commander. gaunt fully trusted the narmenian's judgement in this.  as he looked, he began to discern the flickering display of brief light points out in the hinterland. nachin knows his stuff as well as me. you heard his numbers. a multiple regiment-strength assault. grand-scale armour attack. yet � if what commissar kowle says is correct � not even a fraction of their numbers. even single line abreast, i'd say we were welcoming over half a million down there. gaunt fought hard to screen out the sounds of the assault bombing. he heard vague whispers of the sound mkoll described. at the back of the group, daur noticed that gaunt's adjutant, milo, had crossed to the western lip of the tower and was gazing out. the adjutant was no more than a youth, his pale skin marked by a strange blue tattoo as seemed to be the custom with so many of the ghosts. daur crossed to him, limping. daur smiled encouragingly at milo and then turned away and rejoined the oversight tour. milo felt sorry for him. daur had no experience of the enemy, no knowledge of the way they expended and used their troops wholesale to gain their objectives. the soldiers of vervunhive and the tactics they had evolved were too deeply focused upon the experience of fighting sane enemies. nash agreed vehemently. grizmund nodded. gaunt looked round at him. nash snarled, his heavy chin with its bristle of grey stubble set hard. grizmund asked. he looked back at tarrian. outside, a tank grated past down the river of debris that had once been outhab transit street 287/fd. the soldiers wore ochre battledress, shiny, black leather webbing straps, and polished, newly stamped lasguns. on their heads were full-face composite helmets with flared, sneering features like blurred skulls and the crest of ferrozoica inlayed on the brow. the squad checked each doorway and damage section they came to. gol kolea could hear the hollow crackle of their terse vox-signals barking back and forth. he slid back into cover and made a hand gesture that his company could read. they moved back, swallowed by the shadows and the dust. gol let the five troopers advance down the corridor far enough until the last one was standing on the false flooring. then he connected the bare end of the loose wire in his hand to the terminals of the battery pack. the concussion mine tore out a length of the corridor and obliterated the last trooper where he stood, tearing the one directly in front of him into pieces with fragments of shrapnel and shards of bone from his exploded comrade. the other three fell, then scrambled up, firing blind in the smoke. bright, darting bars of las-fire pierced the smoke cover like reef fish scudding through cloudy water. gol smashed out his fake wall and came down on the first of them from the rear, swinging the hook-bill of his axerake down through helmet and skull. sergeant haller dropped down from the ceiling joists where he had been crouching and felled another of them, killing him with point-blank shots from his autopistol as his bodyweight flattened the trooper. the remaining zoican bastard switched to full auto and swung wild. his withering close-range shots punched right through a flak-board wall partition and blew the guts and thighs out of machinesmith vidor, who had been waiting to spring out from behind it. nessa came out of cover under some loose sacking and slammed the rock-knife into the back of the zoican's neck. she held on, screaming and yanking at the blood-slick knife-grip as the trooper bucked convulsively. by the time he dropped, his head was nearly sawn off. gol hurried forward, picking nessa up and pulling her off the corpse. she nodded. eardrums ruptured by a close shell on the seventh day, she would never hear again without expensive up-hive surgery and implants � which meant simply she would never hear again. she was a trainee medic from the outer habs. not the lowest of the low, but way, way down in the hive class system. she'd learned to sign her remarks early on. captain fencer, the emperor save his soul, had trained her well and explained how she could not modulate the volume of her own voice now she was deaf. gol looked round. haller and the other members of gol's team had recovered four working lasguns, two laspistols and a bunch of ammunition webs from the dead by then. gol ordered, emphasising his words with expressive sign-gestures for the deaf. of his company of nine, six were without hearing. he took a last look at vidor's corpse and nodded a moment of respect. he had liked vidor. he wished the brave machinesmith had found the chance to fight. then he followed his company out. they moved out of the workshop, circuiting back around through a side alley and into a burned-out ecclesiarchy chapel. the bodies of the ministorum brothers lay all around, venting swarms of flies. they had not abandoned their holy place, even when the shells began to fall. haller crossed to the altar, straightened the slightly skewed imperial eagle and knelt in observance. tears dripped down his face, but he still remembered to sign his anguish and his prayer to the emperor rather than speak it. gol noticed this, and was touched and impressed by the soldier's dual devotion to the emperor and to their continued safety. gol got his company into the chapel, spreading them out to cover the openings and find the obvious escape routes. the ground shook as tank rounds took out the workshop where they had sprung their trap. lord heymlik chass sent his servitors and bodyguard away. the chief of the guard, rudrec, his weapon dutifully shrouded, tried to refuse, but chass was not in the mood for argument. alone in the cool, gloomy family chapel of house chass, high up in the main spine upper sectors, the lord prayed diligently to the soul of the undying emperor. the ghosts of his ancestors welled up around him, immortalised in statuary. heymlik chass believed in ghosts. they spoke to him. he unlocked the casket by the high altar between the family stasis-crypts with a geno-key that had been in his family for generations. he raised the velvet-padded lid, hearing the moan of ancient suspensor fields, and lifted out heironymo's amulet. he murmured. yes. that was her mother again, heymlik noticed. he nodded and his head sank. the privy council was a circular theatre set on the spine-floor above the spectacular main hall of the legislature, and it was reserved for the noble houses only. the domed roof was a painted frieze of the emperor and the godmachines of mars hovering in radiant clouds. columns of warm, yellow light stabbed down from the edges of the circular ceiling and lit the velvet thrones of the high houses. apart from chass, they were all there: gavunda, yetch, rodyn, anko, croe, piidestro, nompherenti and vwik. marshal croe stood by his brother, the old, wizened lord croe, in deep conference. vice marshal anko, beaming and obsequious, was introducing general sturm to his resplendently gowned cousin, lord anko. commissar kowle was diplomatically greeting lords gavunda and nompherenti. servants and house retainers thronged the place, running messages, fetching silver platters of refreshments, or simply guarding their noble masters with shrouded sidearms. a gong sounded four strokes. the main gilt shutter at the east side of the room slid up into the ceiling with a hiss and master legislator anophy limped into the chamber, his opalescent robes glinting in the yellow light, his beribboned tricorn nodding with each heavy shuffle he took across the embroidered carpet. he was using the long, golden sceptre of his office as a stick. child pages held his train and carried his gem-encrusted vox/pict drone and book of hive-law before him on tasselled cushions. anophy reached his place. six assent runes, fizzling holograms, lit the air above anophy. the privy council began chattering and moving again. a shutter of herring-bone steel to the west side of the chamber slid open and noble chass, accompanied by his bodyguard, entered the chamber. an awkward hush fell. it remained in place as chass descended the steps, crossed the chamber and took his appointed seat. once they had folded his great, silk train over the throne back, his bodyguard and servants stood away. chass gazed around the circular hall. several of his fellow nobles did not meet his gaze. anophy said. chass looked around again, very conscious of the way lord croe would not look at him. chass shook his head. a group of figures was entering through the east hatch. commissar tarrian was trying to delay them, but they pushed past. it was gaunt, grizmund, nash and their senior officers. gilbear moved forward to confront the roane commander, but sturm held him back with a curt snap of his fingers. gaunt crossed directly to the master legislator's place and took the data-slate from the hands of the surprised page. and i strongly suggest you, and the other off-world commanders with you, show some order of respect and courtesy to the workings and customs of this high parliament. nash snapped, bristling with fury. gaunt took the big roane general by the shoulder and moved him away from confrontation. marshal croe got up. grizmund shook his head sadly. lord chass asked. ibram gaunt's clear, hard voice cut the shouting away. chass asked. but we do know this noble chass wanted to question further, but the privy council dissolved in uproar and gaunt marched out, closely followed by the furious grizmund and nash.  * � ancient proverb the bombardment from the advancing zoican land assault fell abruptly silent in the mid-morning of the twenty-fifth day. hive observers had been carefully tracking the advance of the enemy legions through the outer habs, but by day twenty-two, the level of smoke and ash-clouds veiling the region made such a task impossible once again. eerie silence now fell. no one doubted that this cessation of shelling signalled an imminent storm-assault of the curtain wall and house command ordered a swift redeployment to be made all along the southern defence sections. the curtain wall and gates were already fully manned by the vervun primary troops, and now significant portions of the volpone, roane and northcol armies were brought in to reinforce them. the tanith ghosts were also deployed to the frontline from their chem plant billet where they had been killing the hours in fretful indolence and frustration. gaunt kept some platoons in reserve at the billet, but five platoons under major rawne were sent to the hass west fortress, and another four under colonel corbec were moved to veyveyr gate in support of the three vervun primary and two northcol companies already stationed there. corbec saw the vulnerability of veyveyr gate the moment he and his men arrived by transit truck. superhuman efforts had been made to clear sections of the ruined rail terminal and he and his troops rode in past pioneer teams still clearing rubble or shaping it into effective barricade lines. the gate itself, seventy metres wide and a hundred high, had been blockaded with wreckage, a lot of it burned-out rolling stock from the railhead. but there were no great blast doors to seal it like at the other main wall gates. corbec met with colonel modile and major racine, the ranking vervun officers in the sector, and with colonel bulwar of the northcol contingent. modile was earnest and businesslike, though clearly very nervous about the prospect of seeing action for the first time in his career. corbec didn't like the idea that the officer at the apex of the command pyramid at veyveyr was a combat virgin. the major, racine, was a more likeable fellow, but he was dead on his feet with fatigue. corbec found out later that the vervun primary officer had been awake for the best part of three days straight, supervising the preparation of the veyveyr defence. bulwar at least was a combat veteran who had seen action during the years of rebellion wars in the northcol colonies on verghast's main satellite moon. he was a thickset man who wore the same regular, evergreen flakarmour and fatigues as his men, though the braided cap and the crackling power claw marked him out instantly as a command officer. as the four officers met around the chart table in modile's shelter, corbec soon noticed the way modile deferred to bulwar's suggestions. bulwar saw it too and in effect began to take command. all he had to do was hint and speculate, and modile would quickly take up the ideas and turn them into tactical policy as if they were his own. that's fine and good now, thought corbec, but what happens when the shooting starts? without direct, confident command, the defence would fall apart. bulwar nodded. there were damn lice in those chem barns. my old call sign was �anvil'. let that be a signal to co-ordinate orders above modile's head if it becomes necessary. i won't be hung out to dry by an inexperienced man. corbec nodded. he liked bulwar. he hoped it wouldn't come to that. * * * another day passed, with only silence and smoke outside the curtain wall. nerves began to fray. all the while the shelling had been going on, there had at least been the illusion that a war was being fought. waiting, the common fighting man's worst foe, began to take its toll. anxious minds had time to worry, to fear, to anticipate. nearly three quarters of a million fighting men were in position at the southern curtain wall of vervunhive, with nothing to do but doze, fidget, gaze up at the spectral flashes and crackles of the shield far above, and distress themselves with their own imaginations. the vphc was busy. sixty-seven deserters or suspected derelicts were executed in a twenty-four hour period. on the afternoon of the twenty-seventh day, troops on the wall top began to detect ominous grinding and clanking noises emanating from the smoke cover below. machine noises, vast servos, threshing gears, rattling transmissions, creaking metal. it seemed that at any moment, the storm would begin. but the noises simply continued until after dark and more urgently through the night. they were alien and incomprehensible, like the calls of unseen creatures in some mechanical jungle. the twenty-eighth day was silent. the machine noises ceased at dawn. by noon, the smoke had begun to clear, especially after a rising wind from the southwest brought rain squalls in from the coast. but still visibility was low and the light was poor. there was nothing to see but the grey blur of the mangled outhabs.  on the twenty-ninth day, spotters on the wall near sondar gate sighted a small group of zoican tanks moving along a transit track adjacent to the southern highway, two kilometres out. with hurried permission from house command in the main spine, they addressed six missile batteries and a trio of earthshaker guns and opened fire. there was jubilation all along the defence line, for no greater reasons than the soldiers finally had a visible enemy to target and the fighting drought was broken. the engagement lasted twelve minutes. no fire was returned from the enemy. when the shell-smoke cleared, there was no sign of the tanks that had been fired upon � not even wreckage. during the evening of that day, the machine noises from outside grumbled and clanked again, sporadically. marshal croe made a morale-boosting speech to the population and the troops over the public-address plates. it helped ease the tension, but gaunt knew croe should have been making such speeches daily for the last week. croe had only spoken now on the advice of commissar kowle. despite his dislike of the man, gaunt saw that kowle truly understood the political necessities of war. he was enormously capable. kowle issued a directive that evening urging all commissarial officers, both the vphc and the regular guard, to tour the lines and raise the mood. gaunt had been doing just that since his units went into position, shuttling between hass west and veyveyr. on these tours, he had been impressed by the resolve and discipline of the vervun primary troopers who manned the defences alongside his men. he prayed dearly to the beloved emperor that combat wouldn't sour that determination. on that evening, riding his staff car down the inner transits to check on rawne's units at hass west, gaunt found the seal lord chass' bodyguard had given to him in his coat pocket. there had been no time thus far to pay the noble a visit. gaunt turned the token over in his gloved hand as the car roared down a colonnaded avenue. perhaps tonight, after his inspection of hass west. he never got the chance. just before midnight, as gaunt was still climbing the stairs of the fort's main tower, the first zoican storm began. despite the military preparations, no one in the hive was really prepared for the onslaught. it fell so suddenly. its herald was a simultaneous salvo from thousands of tanks and self-propelled guns prowling forward through the outer-hab wastes less than a kilometre from the wall. the roar shook the hive and the explosive display lit the night sky. for the first time, the enemy was firing up at the curtain wall, point-blank in armour terms, hitting wall-top ramparts and fracturing them apart. precision mortar bombardments were landing on the wall-top itself, finding the vulnerable slit between wall and shield. other ferocious rains of explosive force hammered at the gates or chipped and flaked ceramite armour off the wall's face. the defenders reeled, stunned. hundreds were already dead or seriously injured and the ramparts were significantly damaged in dozens of places. officers rallied the dazed soldiery and the reply began. with its rocket towers, heavy guns, support-weapon emplacements, mortars and the thousands of individual troopers on the ramparts, that reply was monumental. once they began to fight, a gleeful fury seized the men of vervunhive. to address the enemy at last. to fire in anger. it felt good after all the waiting. it was absolving. the curtain wall firepower decimated the zoican forces now advancing towards the wall-foot outside. vervunhive laid down a killing field four hundred metres deep outside their wall and obliterated tanks and men as they churned forward. it was later estimated that 40-50,000 zoican troops and upwards of 6,000 fighting vehicles were lost to vervunhive fire in the first hour of attack. but the sheer numbers of the enemy were overwhelming, both physically and psychologically. no matter how many hundreds were killed, thousands more moved forward relentlessly to take their place, marching over the corpses of the slain. they were mindless and without fear in the face of the mass slaughter. observing this from his trench position just inside veyveyr gate, brin milo reflected that this was precisely what he had been afraid of: the insane tactics of chaos that vervunhive's war plans simply did not take into account. if war is measured by the number of casualties inflicted, then even in that first night, we had won. gaunt took command, calling up a vervun primary vox-officer and grabbing the handset from his pack. gaunt was accompanied by liaison officer daur, who confidently relayed vocal commands to the troops in earshot. gaunt was glad of him. daur knew the tower and knew the men from his time stationed here, and they responded better to an officer of their own. many had seemed overawed by the imperial commissar. gaunt accepted that fear was a command tool, but he loathed what the iron rule of the vphc had done to the resolve of the local troops. gaunt reached rawne on the vox-link. and for all he personally trusted the man no further than he could throw him, gaunt knew that was exactly what rawne would do. bellowed feygor, firing over the buttress. rawne ducked along to him. feygor nodded. bragg nodded and raised the launcher to his shoulder, then banged off three rockets that curled down towards the vast engine on plumes of blue smoke. they hit the superstructure and ignited, but no serious damage was done. the monstrous siege engine reached the foot of the wall and there was a shrieking sound as the metal tower scraped against the ceramite and stone facings. gas-fired anchor ropes were shot into the curtain wall to hold the engine in place. hydraulic feet extended beneath the armour skirts of the engine to steady it on the broken ground. with a wail of metal, the derrick tower began to telescope up, extending to match the height of the wall.  segmented armour, badged with the zoican crest and other, less human insignias that made rawne sick to see them, unfurled upwards to protect the rising throat of the siege tower. at the same time, the base unit of the vast machine opened a well-protected hatch in its rear and zoican troops began to pour into it. the tower-top rose above the wall's lip, forty metres from rawne. hydraulic arms wheezed out and gripped the buttress, steel claws biting into the ceramite. rawne bellowed. the flamers drenched the top of the wall with liquid fire, swivelling to rake the defences back and forth. forty vervun primary troopers and nine ghosts were incinerated as they fled back from the engine. in addition to the shrieking flamers, automatic grenade launchers on the tower-top whirred and began to lob explosives out like hail. multiple detonations exploded along the scorched wall. rawne fell into cover behind a bulwark with bragg, feygor and several other ghosts. feygor was firing his lasgun at the tower, but his shots were simply dinking off the armoured superstructure. rawne ordered trooper gyrd. gyrd, a grizzled ghost in his forties, swung in behind bragg as the big man got the launcher settled on his shoulder. bawled bragg as he sent a missile directly at the tower head. it blew the left-hand flamer mount clean off and ignited a huge fireball of venting prometheum. but the armoured delivery section remained unscathed. the skin on the left-hand side of his face was blackened and scorched by the flamer wash. another moment and that hatch'll open. move back in! urged rawne. six more siege engines had crawled forward towards the curtain wall in the time it had taken rawne to repel the first. relentless fire from missile batteries had taken one apart before it could deploy, just short of the sondar gate. another reached the curtain wall intact but positioned itself in front of an earthshaker heavy battery in the wall side. the massive, long-range cannons blew it apart point-blank, though the crews were fried by the flaming backwash that rushed into their silos. a third reached sondar gate and deployed successfully, rising and clamping to the gatehouse top and then torching everything and everyone on the emplacement before opening its hatch and disgorging wave after wave of zoican heavy troopers. the vervun primary forces were annihilated by this assault, but volpone units from the neighbouring ramparts, under the command of colonel corday, scissored in to meet the invasion. some of the fiercest fighting of the first storm took place then, with twenty units of volpone bluebloods, including a detachment of the elite 10th brigade under major culcis, undertaking a near hand-to-hand battlement fight with thousands of zoican storm troops. the regular bluebloods wore the grey and gold body armour of their regiment, with the distinctive low-brimmed bowl helmets. the elite 10th had carapace armour, matt-black hellguns and bright indigo eagle studs pinned into their armaplas collar sections. culcis, who had won himself a valour medal on vandamaar, was young for a member of the tenth elite, but his superiors had rightly noticed his command qualities. despite seventy per cent losses, he held sondar gate through nothing more than tactical surety and brute determination. the top of sondar gate and the walls adjacent were thick with corpses. culcis and his immediate inferior, sergeant mantes of the regular volpone, tried to disable the siege engine with tank mines. mantes died in the attempt, but the mines blew the support claws off the tower and it collapsed soon after under its own weight. culcis, who had lost a hand in the detonation of the mines, reformed his forces and slaughtered all the remaining zoicans who had made the wall-top. for the first of what would be three serious attempts, sondar gate resisted the enemy. the fourth siege engine reached the wall east of sondar gate, midway along the stretch that curved round to veyveyr. here roane deepers were in position, hard-nosed shock troops in tan fatigues and netted helmets. general nash was in command in person and he mobilised the wall batteries to target the tower neck as it extended up towards them. the ripples of missiles didn't destroy it, but they damaged some internal mechanism and the tower jammed at half-mast, unable to reach the wall top and engage. it raked upwards with its flamers and grenades spitefully, and nash lost more than forty men. but it could not press its assault and remained hunched outside the curtain wall, broken and derelict, for the remainder of the war. the other two siege engines assaulted hass west fort. gaunt saw then coming, slow and inexorable, and drew up his heavy weapons. he'd seen the system of assault through his scope watching rawne's position, and he didn't want it duplicated here. under his voxed commands, the wall batteries strafed the nearest engine heavily and succeeded in blowing it apart. the upper section of the tower, beginning to telescope, snapped off to the left in a fireball, destroying the base unit as it collapsed. but despite gaunt's efforts, the second siege engine reached the western portions of the ramparts and engaged its clamps. the tower hoisted into position. gaunt ordered his men back from the surrounding area as the flamers retched and blasted and the grenades rained. in cover next to him, captain daur pulled off his sling. zoican troops spilled out of the tower top, thousands of them. they were met by the ghosts and the vervun primary. another infamous episode of the first storm began.  they were the size of four or five tanks together, covered in a shell-like carapace of overlapped armour like huge beetles or horseshoe molluscs. a single, super-heavy weapon extended up from their dorsal mounts and they drummed the wall with fastcycle fire that shattered masonry and adamantine blocks. the flat-crabs were siege-crackers, massive weapons designed to break open even the strongest fortifications. two of them, with dorsal mounts slung to face forward and armed with massive rams, assaulted the gates at hass west and sondar. as they advanced, regular tanks, tiny by comparison, moved in beside them. the tidal wave of ochre-clad troops was undiminished. then it was the turn of the spiders, the largest and most fearsome of the zoican siege weapons. a hundred metres long from nose to tail and propelled by eight vast, clawed cartwheels set on cantilever arms extending from the main bodies of their armoured structures, the spiders ground out of the smoke and rumbled towards the wall. gun and rocket batteries on their backs blazed up at the defences of vervunhive. when they reached the curtain wall, the spiders didn't stop. the wheel claws dug into the ceramite and raised the death machines up the face of the defence, climbing like insects up the sheer face of the massive wall. of all the siege engines deployed at vervunhive, the zoican spiders came closer to taking the hive than anything else that night. there were five of them. one was destroyed by the wall guns as it advanced. another was immobilised by rocket fire twenty metres short of the wall and then set on fire by further salvos. the other three made it to the walls and hauled their immense bulks upwards, screeching into adamantium and ceramite as they dug with their wheeled claws. one was stopped by the vphc commissar vokane, who got his troops to roll munitions from the launcher dumps to the wall head and tip them over onto the rising beast, charges set for short fuse. the spider was blown off the wall and fell backwards, crushing hundreds of zoican troops under it. it lay on its back and burned. vokane and fifty-seven of his men didn't live to cheer. the explosive backwash of the spider's death engulfed them and burned them to bone scraps. the second spider made it to veyveyr gate and began to claw at the barricades. its mighty wheels sliced and crushed rail stock apart as it pulled itself in through the gate opening. heavy artillery and northcol armour units met it with a pugnacious blitz of fire as it pushed its head through the gateway and they blew it apart. it settled sideways on its exploded wheels, half-blocking the entrance. the remaining spider clawed its way over the curtain wall west of hass west fort. general grizmund was waiting for it. as it scattered and burned the wall defenders to left and right, grizmund's narmenian tanks, assembled in the open places of the house anko chem works, elevated and fired, blasting the vast thing backwards off the curtain wall. the force of the salvo took part of the inner wall down too, but it was considered worthwhile. the spider was destroyed. at hass west, gaunt's men met the tide of zoicans spilling from the engaged siege engine. in the narrow defiles of the ramparts, it became a match of determined close combat. gaunt personally killed dozens with his chainsword and cut a flanking formation down towards the tower-top of the engine. daur was with him, blasting with his borrowed boltgun, and so were a pack of more than sixty ghosts and vervun primary troopers mixed together. squads under varl and mkoll joined them, and gaunt was gratified that they seemed to be killing the storm troops as fast as the foes could stream out of the boarding tower. gaunt heard a yell through the confusion and looked up to see commissar kowle leading fifty or so vervun primary troops in an interception along the lower battlements. between them, gaunt realised, they had the enemy pinned. he hissed back to daur. the captain called up a grenadier with fat pouches of tube mines and antipersonnel bombs. gaunt advanced through the enemy waves, his chainsword biting blood, armour shards, hair and flesh from them. he cut a space to the tower head and then yelled for the grenadier to follow up. a las-shot tore through the grenadier's brow and he fell. daur ran forward and helped the commissar. together, they lifted the corpse, laden with its strings of explosives, and carried it to the open mouth of the tower. gaunt pulled out a stick charge, set it, pushed it back into the corpse's webbing and together they flung the dead soldier down through the mouth of the siege tower. the grenade went off a couple of seconds later. a bare millisecond after that, the rest of his munitions exploded as he fell, touched off by the first bomb. the tower shuddered and broke, falling headlong into the sea of zoicans milling at the foot of the curtain wall. kowle's forces moved in, killing the last of the zoicans on the ramparts. at two in the morning, just into the thirtieth day, the zoican assault stopped and the zoicans withdrew into the smouldering shadows of the outhabs. flat-crabs wallowed backwards into the smoke, escorted by files of zoican tanks and legions of ochre troops. an imperial victory hymn was played at full volume from every broadcast speaker in the hive. vervunhive had lost 34,000 troops, twenty missile emplacements, fifty gun posts and ten heavy artillery silos. the curtain wall was scarred and wounded and, in several places, fractured to the point of weakness. but the first storm had been resisted. �commissar-general delane oktar, from his epistles to the hyrkans processions of ministorum priests, the high faithful of the imperial cult, moved through the stone vaults of inner hab collective medical hall 67/mv. they carried tapers and smoking censers, and chanted litanies of salvation and blessing for the wounded and dying now engulfing the place. long, frail strips of parchment inscribed with the speeches of the emperor trailed behind them like sloughs of snakeskin, dangling from the prayer boxes they carried. surgeon ana curth nodded respectfully to the clerics each time she encountered them in the wards and hallways of the medical facility, but privately she cursed them. they were in the way and they terrified some of the weaker or more critically injured who saw them as soul-catchers come to draw them from this life. spiritual deliverance was all very well, but there was a physical crisis at hand, one in which any able personnel would help more by tending the bodies rather than the spirits. the zoican assault had brought convoys of new casualties to all the inner hive medical halls, places already barely coping with the sick and injured refugees from the first phase of the conflict. military field hospitals and medical stations were being set up to help, and the medical officers and staff that had arrived with the imperial guard forces were proving to be invaluable. curth and her colleagues were community medics with vast experience in every walk of life � except combat injuries. it was evening on the thirtieth day and curth had been on duty for nearly twenty hours.  after the nightmare of the storm assault the previous night, the fighting had slowed, with nothing more than random exchanges of shelling from both sides across the litter of zoican dead outside the wall. or so curth had heard from passing soldiers and administratum officials. she'd barely had time to raise her head above the endless work. she paused to scrub her hands in a water bath, partly to clean them but mainly to feel the refreshingly cold liquid on her fingers. she looked up to see groups of dirty vervun primary troopers wheeling a dozen or more of their wounded comrades down the hall on brass gurneys. some of the wounded were whimpering. several troopers protested. your name? another squeal of not-words. a stammering. a lifelong abuser. there could be no reasoning here. curth doubted the worker would ever be able to kick the habit that was destroying his brain. get me two shots of lomitamol. one of the orderlies hurried off. she sent the other away to encourage patients back to their cots. there was a pause in the background noise of the ward, just for a second. curth had her back to the worker and realised her oh-so-very-basic mistake. she turned in time to see him leaping at her, lips drawn back from his rotting teeth, a rusty clasp-knife in one hand. wondering stupidly how in the name of the emperor he'd got that weapon into the hall unchecked, she managed to sidestep. the worker half-slammed into her and she went over backwards, overturning a water cart. the bottles smashed on the tiles. the worker, making a high-pitched whining sound, stepped over the mess while trying to keep his balance. he stabbed the knife at her and she cried out, rolling aside and cutting her arm on the broken glass. she scrabbled to rise, expecting to feel him plant the blade in her back at any moment. turning, she saw him choking and gagging, held in a firm choke-hold from behind. dorden, the tanith medical officer, had his left arm braced around the addict's neck, his right hand holding the knife-wrist tightly at full length away from them both. the addict gurgled. dorden was completely tranquil. his hold was an expert move, just a millimetre or two of pressure away from clamping the carotid arteries, just a centimetre away from dislocating the neck. only a brilliant medic or an imperial assassin could be that precise. restrain him. give him the lomitamol, but restrain him all the same. you should try it. you won't be disturbed. that made her laugh. learn the lessons, surgeon curth. make time to nap. trust your friends. they walked down the hallway together, passing two crash-teams racing critical cases to the theatre. was that it? and i'm seeing over a dozen shared between the two of them. they were shot at close range. i checked the records. twelve others were brought in from the same site with identical wounds. dorden was right: this was small compared to the scale of the general human misery in vervunhive. but it could not go unmarked. the scholam medicalis had trained her to value every single life individually. trooper cocoer hissed. he took it with a nod and the servitor withdrew to the side of the room. gaunt sipped the drink thoughtfully. he was beginning to wonder why he had come. it was clear there was a universe of difference between himself and chass. what could they have in common? gaunt turned and faced a young noblewoman who had entered from the far side of the anteroom. she wore a long gown of yellow silk, with a fur stole and an ornate headdress of silver wire and jewels. she was almost painfully beautiful and gaunt saw cunning intelligence in her perfect face. he nodded respectfully, with a click of his heels. indeed they do. war heroes kowle can manage to stomach, so they report, but a commissar war hero? famous for his actions on balhaut, fortis binary, the menazoid clasp, monthax? too much for kowle. you might eclipse him. i'm not interested in rivalry. she smiled dangerously. what was it they said? your �scruffy, courageous ghost warriors'. though she was lovely, he had already had enough of her superior manner and courtly flirting. responding to such things could get a man shot. gaunt bowed gently again. he took another sip of the drink. she said fiercely. chass is one of the most powerful noble houses and one of the oldest, but it is part of the minority. croe and anko hold power and opposition. anko especially. my father is what they call a liberal. he has� lofty ideals and is a generous and honest man. but he is also guileless, vulnerable. a crafty political agent could use his honesty and betray him. gaunt shrugged. he looked around the metal garden. merity stood back from the pair. chass nodded and the girl stalked away between the wire-vines and the tin blooms. they moved through a grove of platinum trees heavy with brass oranges. frills of wire-lace creepers were soldered to the burnished trunks. beyond the grove, crossing iron lawns that creaked under their footsteps, they walked down a row of bushes with broad, inlaid leaves of soft bronze. chass led gaunt into a maze of hedges. chass snorted, taking a cropping wand from his belt. so do i. from the incident in the privy council the other day gaunt's measured nod spoke for him. chass wanded the hedge again. wear this for honour. chass stood alone as gaunt threaded his way out of the metal garden and departed. � warmaster slaydo, on his deathbed it was a dismal, hollow dawn. the early daylight was diffused by cliffs of grey cloud that prolonged the night. rain began to fall: spots at first for a half hour, then heavier, sheeting across the vastness of the hive and the wastelands beyond. visibility dropped to a few hundred metres. the torrential downpour made the shield crackle and short in edgy, disturbing patterns. at the veyveyr position, in the first hour of light, colm corbec walked the tanith line, the eastern positions of the ruined railhead. his piebald camo-cloak, the distinctive garb of the tanith, was pulled around him like a shroud, and he had acquired a wide-brimmed bowl helmet from somewhere � the northcol troops most likely � which made more than a few of his ghosts chuckle at the sight of it. it was cold, but at least the shield high above was keeping the rain off. corbec had surveyed the ghost positions a dozen times and liked them less each time he did. there was a group of engine sheds and cargo halls through which sidings ran, all of them bombed-out, and then a forest of rubble and exploded fuel tanks leading down to the vast main gate, the white stone of its great mouth scorched black. beyond the rear extremity of the railyard's eastern border rose the burned-out smelteries. a regiment of vervun primary troops � called the spoilers, corbec had been told � held that position and watched the approach up the treacherous slagmountain. corbec had around two hundred ghosts dug in through the engine sheds and the rubble beyond, with forward scout teams at the leading edge towards the gate. colonel modile's vervun primary units, almost five thousand strong, manned the main trenches and rubble glacis in the central sector of the wide railyard. bulwar's northcol troops, two thousand or more, were positioned along the west, towards proud and grimy rows of as yet undamaged manufactories. fifty units of northcol armour waited at the north end of the railhead in access roads and marshalling yards, ready to drive forward in the event of a breakthrough. corbec crossed between fire-blackened, roofless engine sheds, his hefty boots crunching into the thick crust of ash and rubble that littered the place despite the pioneer teams' clearance work. in the shed, twenty ghosts were standing easy, all except their spotters at blast-holes and windows, looking south. the roof was bare ribs and tangles of reinforcing metal strands poked from broken rockcrete. corbec crossed to where scout mkvenner and trooper mochran squatted on a makeshift firestep of oil drums, gazing out through holes in the brickwork. its massive bulk, slumped across the gatemouth barricades, half blocked the entrance and had proved impossible to shift, despite the efforts of pioneer teams and sappers with dozers and heavy lifters. corbec saw the trooper was right. enemy infantry could come worming in around the bulk and be inside before they were visible. the war machine gave the enemy a bridge right in through the tangled, rusting hulks of the gate barricade. corbec told them something reassuring and light that made them both laugh. afterwards, though he tried, he could not recall what it was. he sauntered southwards, skirting through a trenchline and entered the rubble scarps closer to the gate.  he had eleven heavy weapon teams tied in here at intervals behind flakboards and bagging. six heavy stubbers on tripod mounts, two autoguns on bipods with ammo feeders sprawled on their bellies next to the gunners, and three missile launchers. between the weapon positions, tanith troopers were spread in lines along the embrasures. walking amongst them, corbec sensed their vulnerability. there was nothing to their rear and east flank but the ruined smelteries and the spoil. corbec opened his vox-link and called up three flamer-parties from the reserves behind the engine sheds. now he was out here, with dawn upon them, he could see how raw and open the scene was, and he wanted it secured. he found larkin in a foxhole close to the gates. the wiry sniper was breaking down his specialised lasgun and cleaning it. larkin clacked a fresh, reinforced barrel into place and then stroked a film of gun-oil off the exchanger before sliding one of the hefty charge packs into its slot. corbec sat down beside larkin and took a moment to check his own lasgun. larkin snorted and clicked his scope gently into place on the top of the weapon. corbec acknowledged. he looked up at the huge wall and the towering top of the gatehouse. he often forgot that they had men and positions up there, thousands of them, a hundred metres up, blessed with oversight and a commanding position of fire. never. but that's usual. bring 'em on. that was what his mouth said, anyway. the sound was utterly stolen by a marrow-pulping impact of shells and las-fire that bracketed the gatehouse and shook the wall. billows of flame belched in over the ruined death machine and the barricade and swirled up above the railyard. parts of the barricade, sections of rolling stock, fifty tonnes apiece, shredded and blew inwards. corbec dropped. billions of zinging shards of shrapnel, many white-hot, whickered down over the tanith lines. already, he could hear urgent calls over his link for medics coming from the vervun primary positions in the centre of the yard. he swung round and saw shells falling in the spoil behind the tanith position, blowing up fierce spumes of rock-waste. the second storm had started. ferrozoica changed tactics for its second assault. the first storm had been an all-out, comprehensive attack along the southern curtain wall. this time they began a sustained bombardment of the wall length to keep vervunhive reeling and they focussed their invasion to three point-assaults. another slid west along the eastern rail-lines and struck at croe gate and the railhead behind it with battalionstrength force. the fighting in that sector, fronted by vervun primary and roane deeper regiments, lasted until the early afternoon. the third attack went straight in for the vulnerable veyveyr gate. in the first ten minutes of the second storm, flat-crabs and other heavy artillery siege-crackers brought down the barricade and blasted apart the corpse of the spider. the first flat-crab rolled right in through the gate, squashing metal and splintering rubble, driving down into the vervun primary positions in the main yard. further artillery obliterated all defences along the bastions of the gateway and the walls nearby, and veyveyr found itself shorn of its precious raised gunnery positions. there were a few, desperate minutes of confusion as colonel modile tried to rally his splintered ground forces in the main area of the yard. they were falling back in droves before the armour attack, stampeding down the trenchways to escape the insurmountable power of the zoican death machine. a second flat-crab began to grind in behind the first, searing shells to the right into the tanith positions. modile fabricated a clumsy counter-assault and withdrew his infantry in a v-shape, allowing the northcol armour to press forward to meet the siege engines. the railhead air was full of clanking tracks and whinnying shells as the formations moved in. northcol tanks were blown apart by the heavy dorsal cannons of the flat-crabs, and other tanks and chimeras were crushed flat under the siege engine's tracks. all the infantry, ghosts included, could do little but cower in the face of this monumental clash. the noise level was physically painful and the ground trembled. there was a vast detonation and a cheer went up all along the infantry lines. sustained fire from three dozen northcol tanks had finally crippled the first flat-crab and blown it apart. the second, grinding through the gate, was blocked by the wreck. corbec scurried round in his cover and started to break towards the flank of the second crab. larkin caught him by the arm. corbec crawled up alongside him. zoican infantry, hundreds of them, were charging through the breach the flat-crabs had gouged, pouring through veyveyr gate itself. corbec began to fire. the thin crack of his lasgun was quickly joined by the heavier whine of larkin's sniper weapon. the support weapons along the tanith lines opened up behind them. missiles from the heavy weapon positions hissed above his head as brin milo bellied forward through the rubble and began to scope for enemy infantry. colonel corbec's hasty orders were crackling over the vox-link. hell was erupting around them. milo saw a few ochre shapes clambering across the dead zone in the gate mouth and took aim. his first shot went wide, but he adjusted and dropped a zoican with his second and his third. trooper baffels and trooper yarch flung themselves down beside him and started firing too. las-fire slashed back and forth across the railyard, flickering in multicoloured, searing lines. someone a few metres away was screaming. milo tried to shut it out. he aimed his weapon as larkin had taught him, kept his breathing slow, squeezed. a blurt of las-fire. an ochre warrior spun off his feet. yarch crawled up to the lip of the embrasure and primed a grenade. he tossed it and a crumping vortex of wind blew grit back onto them. milo and baffels never found out what yarch was planning. a las-round entered his skull though his nose-bone, blowing out the back of his head.  as he rose weightlessly and jerked back, two more lasrounds hit him, one through the throat and the other through the eye. he tumbled down the rubble. another lost man lost. baffels, a bearded man in his early forties with a barrel chest and a blue tattoo claw that lined his cheek, pulled milo back into cover as tremendous las-fire exploded along their trench top. together, they crawled down into the trench bottom and found fulch, mkfeyd and dremmond trying to edge round south. a light-storm of las-fire drummed around them. a ricochet hit fulch in the buttock and dropped him to his knees. mkfeyd tried to rise to the fire step, but las-fire walked along its edge, exploding the fore-grip of his weapon and taking off the tops of two fingers of his left hand. he fell back, cursing his luck and jetting the others with bright, red blood. milo started to bind mkfeyd's fingers with strips of field bandage, keeping his head low. baffels was trying to patch the oozing wound in fulch's hindquarters and was calling for a medic over his vox-link. dremmond, who was bringing one of the flamers corbec had requested forward, crawled up to the lip and sent withering blasts of incendiary death over the top. he was already boasting a flamer-tan from the first storm, in which he had fought at hass west. more troopers battled along to join them. some, led by sergeant fols, went ahead down the zag in the trench line to create an enfilade. milo looked up from his work with mkfeyd's hand, his face smeared and dripping with blood, as a trooper nearby was cut in two. milo said to the injured man, then crawled up to take his place at the firestep too. mkfeyd was working on pure adrenaline now and he crawled up alongside the boy. he managed to brace his gun with his bandaged hand and began firing. the line of ghost lasguns barked and flashed down the length of the eastern position. mkvenner moved his team out of the engine shed just as shelling from the second flat-crab blew it out. mochran was already dead, punctured apart by a series of stub-rounds that had perforated the shed wall. mkvenner had ordered his unit to fix bayonets � the long silver daggers of the tanith � at some point early in the assault, and now he was glad of it. zoican infantry, their faces hidden by those sculpted ochre masks, were pouring into the tanith trench lines from the south. with no more than fifteen men around him, mkvenner engaged them, stabbing and slicing, firing weapons point-blank. the zoicans were overrunning them. there seemed no end to the numbers of ochre enemy. as fast as mkvenner could kill them, there were more. it was like fighting the ocean tide. major racine, of the vervun primary, had been out inspecting the forward arrays of his veyveyr positions when the storm came down. he had tried to control the retreat and he debated fiercely with colonel modile about how best to counter the zoican push. after a few bitter returns over the vox-line, it had gone dead. modile clearly didn't want to argue with his subaltern anymore. racine had five hundred men behind a glacis of rubble in the main yard, facing the encroachment of the second flat-crab. he called up his bombardier and took three satchels full of mine charges and grenades. then he hauled himself over the lip and ran towards the siege engine. a raging storm of las � and bolt-rounds whipped around him. not one touched him. all that saw it regarded it as a miracle. racine was ten metres from the vast supertank, with its grinding segmented armour, when a las-round went through his ear into his brain and killed him. he dropped. there was a dreadful hiss of wronged valour and injustice from his watching troops. he had got so close. the flat-crab ground forward, crushing racine's corpse into the ash. the pressure set off the charges looped around him. the vast cannonade of explosions flipped the crab up and over on its rear end. quick-thinking gunners in the northcol armour hit its exposed belly hard. one shell touched off its magazine and it vaporised in a colossal jet of fire that blew out the top of veyveyr gate itself. the vervun primary troops, wilting and shattered in the aftershock, swore that racine would be remembered. the zoican troops were all over them. corbec edged down a gully that had once been a side street in the railyard, the walls still standing, scarred and crater-peppered, around him. he had sixteen men with him, including larkin and trooper genx, who carried a bipod autocannon. corbec's first thought was to order his men to hug the walls, but the streets seemed to funnel and corral the enemy fire, and las � and bolt-rounds ricocheted along them. he'd already lost three men who had kept to the walls and been blown down by the fire sliding down them. it was safer to stand out in the middle of the street. they pushed ahead and met a detachment of zoican storm troops, at least fifty of them, pouring into the eastern positions. fire walloped back at them and corbec marvelled at the way the lasrounds kissed and followed the stone walls. trooper fanck dropped, his chest gone. trooper manik was hit in the groin and his screams echoed around them. an enemy round took off his hand at the wrist and corbec scooped up the autocannon and fired it himself. genx, his stump instantly cauterised by the las-fire, got up without comment and began to feed his colonel's weapon. larkin took his targets as they came, blowing off heads or blowing out chests with the powerful kick of his sniper gun. the las-fire of the normal weapons was superhot but lacked stopping power. larkin blanched as men beside him hit enemy troops who kept going despite precise hits which had passed through them cleanly. only larkin's sniper gun and corbec's autocannon were actually dropping the foe first time so they wouldn't get up again. the northcol were almost overrun. morning itself was rising above it all, unnoticed. at sondar gate, after more than two hours of intense fighting, the zoican attack was driven off. grizmund's narmenian tanks had assembled in the square of marshals just inside the gate ready to face any force that broke in. they stood in rumbling lines just like vegolain's had done in the first hours of the war, over a month before. when the push at sondar was repulsed, house command signalled grizmund to pull out and deploy along the southern manufactory highway to reinforce veyveyr gate. two regiments of vervun primary mechanised and a volpone battlegroup were also directed to support veyveyr, but the orders, handed down by vice marshal anko, were imprecise and the reinforcement elements became throttled in queues on the arterial routes. grizmund, frustrated and unable to get clear direction from house command, moved his armour column off the highway and tried to approach veyveyr via stock yards behind the manufactories. proper authorisation for this was impossible as the vox-links were jammed with chatter from the chaos at the railhead.  grizmund had gone about two kilometres, forcing his tanks through chainlink fences and razorwire barricades, when vphc units bellowing curses and orders through loudhailers headed them off and demanded they return to the highway. the confrontation grew ugly. grizmund himself descended from his tank and approached the vphc troops directly, arguing that his unorthodox route was necessary. tempers flew and when one of the vphc commissars drew a pistol, grizmund knocked him down. there was a brief brawl and the astonished grizmund found himself and four of his senior commanders arrested at gunpoint. the vphc dragged them off to house command, leaving the narmenian tank force leaderless and stymied, under the close watch of a growing force of vphc. the lack of concerted direction from house command caused other disasters that made a bad day worse. the vervun primary and volpone reinforcements were stalled all along the southern access. one group of vervun motortroops riding half-tracks with hydra batteries mounted on the flatbeds were trapped in a side transit rout. in their agitation, they mistook a unit of volpone chimeras advancing behind them for an enemy force. by that stage, with nothing coming over the vox-links but undisciplined terror and panic from veyveyr gate, there was a general impression that the zoicans had forced entry into the hive and were sacking the southern quarters. the hydra batteries opened fire, briefly, until the mistake was discovered. by then, thirteen volpone troops were dead. the second storm was showing up a great weakness in the vervunhive command structure. vervun primary, house command and the vhpc had communication protocols and designated channels which worked efficiently during peace time or practice drills, but which were incapable of handling the sudden spikes in vox-traffic that accompanied heavy fighting. worse still, the house command vox-system, modelled on imperial standard, used the same channel bands as the imperial guard and the northcol. within an hour of the assault starting, it was virtually impossible for any unit commander to talk long range to his troops or for any order signals from house command to reach the ground. it was even impossible to vox house command for clarification. only short-range vox-links between troops and officers in the field ground were still functioning. some commanders tried to switch channels, hoping their men would have the same idea, but there was little chance of officers and men guessing the same new channel simultaneously. at croe gate, general nash had a measure of success. he switched to a wideband his roane deepers had famously been forced to use once on kroxis and his vox-staffers on the ground had the same idea. for most of the day, nash was the only senior commander in the field to have a direct open link to his forces. a volpone force under corday also managed to resume contact with its distant elements. corday adroitly used his short-range micro-beads to relay the new channel setting from man to man through the field. unfortunately, he had chosen a channel that was crippled by interference from the shield harmonics. at veyveyr, matters were made worse by the fact that modile had shut down the main channel to cut off the demands of his officers � men like the late racine � who were now questioning modile's orders. gaunt, who had been at hass west when the storm began, immediately headed for veyveyr with daur and a platoon of tanith. their troop-truck convoy found the back end of the reinforcement columns jammed fast and they struggled to find a way around or through. gaunt tried raglon's vox-set frantically to get house command to rectify the growing logistical disaster, but he found the lines as jammed as the other commanders had before him. he handed the speaker horn back to raglon and looked down at the pale-faced daur. the rumble and roar of the nightmarish veyveyr battle backlit the buildings and habs ahead of them. gaunt snapped. gaunt eyed the solid wall of troops and troop carriers choking the highway ahead and cursed quietly. establishing proper and workable vox-protocols would be his priority once this day was done. the vervun primary were brave men and the noble houses were honourable institutions, but in war they were rank amateurs. gaunt yelled back down his force and leaped out of the lead truck. daur joined him, prepping the lasrifle he had drawn from stores after the first storm. his arm still hurt and wasn't mended, but it worked well enough for him to carry a weapon and he'd be damned if he was going to follow the commissar into action again and have to ask to borrow a gun. he gulped down a couple of painkiller tablets to soothe the ache. the fifty tanith ghosts had assembled on the road beside the trucks. gaunt walked down the rank, speaking directly and briefly. ahead, i think! milo nodded. he could smell prometheum. encouraged that they might be closing on their forward element, the platoon rallied and pushed forward. milo realised that they seemed to be following him, looking to him for leadership, with sergeant fols absent. it was mad � they all had more combat experience than him, and all were older. it was as if the gloss of gaunt was on him, as if he represented some kind of natural authority simply by association with the commissar. the cover ahead broke into a series of low-dug ditches punctuated with shell-craters. enemy fire was sheeting across it, making it impassable. no, i'm fine� they had a victory and a hero, and that was all that mattered. gaunt and his small reinforcement group reached veyveyr just as the battle was ending. gaunt was hot with anger and determination. daur led him down a trench to the vervun primary command post where colonel modile was rallying men and directing vox-links. the ghosts fanned out to do so and the vervun primary staffers blinked in confusion as they were jostled around. modile asked haughtily. potentially, that reputation makes me soft. gaunt removed his cap and handed it to daur. he stared at modile, who still wasn't sure what was going on. commissar gaunt. do not speak further. modile backed away, suddenly, horribly realising what was happening. modile stammered, lost control of his bowels and turned to run. �surgeon master goleca, after the exsanguination of augustus ix from the sound of it, there was a hell of a brawl going on at veyveyr gate. the sky under the shield blazed up at intervals with explosive light, and sound drummed across the hive. it had been going on since daybreak. the baby, yoncy, was crying plaintively and making sobbing, sucking noises. it had been doing it all night. tona wasn't sure what to do. dalin was sullen and quiet, and he slept in the back of the trash-cave most of the time. tona crawled forward out of her dugout and looked across the shell-ruined slopes. below, half a kilometre away, lay the fenced and razor-wired troop billet of gavunda chem plant storebarns/southwest. that was where the off-world soldiers lived, the pale-skinned, dark-haired ones with their black costumes and blue tattoos. tona wondered if they came from a hiveworld too, if the blue tats were gang badges or rank marks. she dreamed of their food. there was a banquet fit for the emperor secured down there in the back sheds. she'd sent dalin in to scrounge and steal a few times, but it was getting dangerous. tona knew it was up to her now. the baby was weak and crying. she needed milk powder and basic nutrient paste. there were over a thousand other refugees hiding in the trash slopes and crater-plains in the shell-flattened manufactories near to her, but she never thought to ask any for help. everyone in vervunhive was on their own now. a particularly fierce airburst cracked the sky above veyveyr, and tona turned to look. she'd been to veyveyr railhead a few times and had stood in the glass hall of the main station, now long gone, watching the snooty up-spine travellers move to and fro from platforms. her twice-uncle rika had run a snack-stall there, and she'd also been a part of a pocket-prey team for a few months. the grand terminus had awed her, even as she worked it. it had seemed to her a doorway to anywhere. if she'd had the credit, she'd have jumped a train south to the tropical hives, to the archipelago, maybe even to verghast badport where, so they said, it was possible to buy a route to anywhere, including off-world. veyveyr gate had always seemed to her a way off this rock. a possible future. a promise. now it was dead and burned out, and callous, off-world soldiers dirtied it with brutal war. the baby was squalling again. he stepped forward and holstered his pistol. what's your name? hello? hello? you need this. you really do. hello? medic! he cried out, pulling back from the ruined thing he had been touching. a thickset medical officer pushed through the milling crowd, a man in his fifties with a silver beard and the look of an off-worlder about him. under his hall-issue crimson apron he wore black fatigues and guard-issue boots. gak me, i suppose so. tried to move him. dead. soric nodded as the medic stood up, folding his scope-tube away into his shoulder-slung pack. soric gestured over his shoulder at the ruin of vervun smeltery one east of the railhead. asked dorden, stepping forward. as if on cue, vphc troops wheeled past a cart carrying a screaming, blood-soaked northcol soldier. mtane and one of curth's people hurried to it. dorden looked round at soric. troopers milo and baffels were carrying manik, howling from the wound to his groin, blood dribbling over the edges of the stretcher. dorden moved in to deal with manik. he was sure the young trooper was going to bleed out any moment. dorden's hands were already slippery with manik's blood. the groin artery had burst and he couldn't tie it. milo said, standing back from manik's stretcher, adjusting the dressing on his shoulder wound. soric listened to the off-world boy and shook his head sadly. lesp stumbled over the rubble and brought dorden a scalpel. dorden used it to try and open the screaming manik's groin wide enough so he could push his fingers in and pull the severed artery down to clamp it. it was too late. manik bled out through his body cavity and died with dorden's hand still inside him. * * * ana curth moved her orderlies through the confusion of veyveyr gate. there were more dead to recover than living. she checked each corpse in turn, pulled off the tags and then left them for the recovery units. she hesitated slightly when she found the corpses of tanith. these were all dorden's friends. she took off their tags carefully and entered all the names in her dataslate. in the gateway of veyveyr, she paused. she checked the latest set of tags three times to be sure. tears welled in her eyes and she pushed the bloody tags into her apron-front. the thirty-second day drew to a close. it was a day the citizens of vervun-hive would remember perhaps more keenly than anything that had taken place so far. despite the success of driving back the first storm three days before, this seemed much more of a victory. scant hours after the battle, the defence of veyveyr began to take on a mythical flavour. in the spine, the habs and the refuges alike, vervunhivers spoke of it as a turning point, as the start of deliverance. public-address plates across the hive broadcast triumphant slogans, sanitised accounts of the battle and pictures from the glorious front, mainly those showing the people's hero raising the flag in the shattered gate-mouth, surrounded by jubilant vervun primary troopers. in the basilica of the ecclesiarchy, a victory mass was organised, featuring a choir of over ten thousand and long liturgical readings from the codex imperialis. loudspeakers broadcast the worship across all the hive levels. spontaneous celebrations began in different areas and some revels � amongst vervun primary troops heady with relief � were broken up by the vphc. but the mood was impossible to suppress in the highest and lowest quarters of the hive. oilcan fires were lit along the wharves and in the refuges, and drums, many homemade or improvised, thundered into the night. there were many reports of decadent banqueting in the high spine, as merchants and house ordinary families abandoned the rationing restrictions and indulged in sumptuous private dinners of unstinting debauchery. when gaunt heard about them, he sighed. these were either gestures of ignorance or acts of denial against what must surely still await. but let them have their delights, he decided. they may be their last. in a grim mood, he'd stayed on at veyveyr as the light failed, touring his men, noting those lost, restructuring squads around those losses. he gave trooper baffels a field promotion to sergeant and placed him in charge of fols' unit. the stocky, bearded trooper was almost overcome with emotion as neskon, domor, milo and the others cheered him. he shook gaunt's hand and wiped away a tear that trickled down over his blue claw tattoo. there had been a brief rumour that gaunt would award the sergeant pin to milo, but that was absurd. he was barely a trooper and it wouldn't look right, though milo's actions and improvised leadership at veyveyr had won him a considerable respect that sat well with his reputation as the avatar of gaunt. under corbec's command, the tanith units who had seen action at veyveyr pulled out to a mustering yard north of the spoil, and fresh units under rawne, partnered with volpone forces commanded by colonel corday, moved in to hold the gate position. stonemasons, metalworkers and engineers from the hab workforce were called up to assist the sapper units in defending the gate. using fallen stone from the gate top, the masons erected two well-finished dyke walls just outside the gate, and the incandescent glare of oxylene torches fizzled in the night rain as the metalwrights crafted pavises and hoardings from broken tank plates. sections of rail � and there were kilometres of it scattered throughout the railhead � were broken up and welded into cross-frames to carry barbed wire and razorwire strings. in an intensive twelve-hour period, with work continuing throughout the night under lamp-rigs, the workforce raised impressive concentric rings of well-built defences both inside and outside the broken gate. there were ramps along the eastern edge to allow forward access for the northcol tank files marshalled behind the troop lines. a forest of howitzers, barrels raised almost upright like slightly leaning trees, was established on the site of the main terminus, with a clear field of fire to bombard up and beyond the gate. in the mustering yard, weary tanith and northcol units from the front sprawled on rolled up jackets or on the hardpan itself, many falling asleep as soon as they got off their feet.  mess trucks with tureens of soup, baskets of bread and crates of weak beer arrived to tend them. it was estimated that they would be there until dawn, when the arterial routes would be finally clear enough for transports to carry them back to their billets. in the gloomy rear section of a northcol chimera, corbec and bulwar shared a bottle and dissected the day. the performance of the vervun troops and of modile especially was cursed frequently. the bottle was vintage sacra from corbec's own stock and he broke the wax-foil stamp with relish. bulwar had set his power-claw on a metal rack and, flexing fingers stiff from the glove, produced two shot glasses from a leather box, and a tin of fat smokes, the best brand the northern collective hives produced. bulwar had never tasted the tanith liquor before, but he didn't flinch and corbec wasn't surprised. bulwar was as grizzled and hardened a soldier as any corbec had met in his career. bulwar nodded. metal hip. a stub round during the moon war. wanted to muster for the guard at the last founding, but i was a major by then and my path was set. corbec toyed with the tiny glass in his paw. three regiments assembled to join the warmaster's crusade. this was just after balhaut, you understand. gaunt had been sent to knock us into shape. there was a� a miscalculation. a chaos fleet slipped through the interdiction set up by the advancing segmentum pacificus navy and assaulted tanith. i like old ibram gaunt, but he's a commissar at heart. hardline, worships the emperor above his own life, dedicated to discipline. he took us out, about two thousand of us, and tanith burned as we left it behind. we've been paying back the enemy ever since. corbec smiled. by a roaring oil-drum fire, baffels sat with milo, venar, filain and domor. filain and venar were snoring, propped against each other. domor was spooning soup into his mouth with weary, almost mechanical motions. milo nodded. milo looked into the fire. he could sense baffels was scared by his new responsibilities. the man was a great soldier, but he'd never expected unit command. he didn't want to fail and milo knew he wouldn't, just as gaunt had known when he'd made the promotion. but if it helped baffels' confidence, milo would do as he was asked. certainly, through that strange, organic process milo had observed in the firefight that morning, soldiers chose their own leaders in extremis, and baffels and milo had been chosen. milo nodded. the tune was the unofficial anthem of tanith, more sprightly than the actual planetary anthem, yet melancholy and almost painful for any man of tanith to hear. he began to play. the tune rose above the yard, above the flurries of sparks rising from the oil drums. one by one, the men began to sing. asked bulwar hoarsely as corbec sang softly. the main spine rang with the sound of massed voices. in the halls of the legislature and the grand regimental chapel of house command, victory choirs thousands strong sang victory masses and hymns of deliverance.  crossing a marble colonnade with captain daur and several officers on the approach to house command, gaunt paused on a balcony and looked down into the regimental chapel auditorium. he sent his contingent on ahead and stood watching the mass for a while. the auditorium's high, arched roof was adorned with company banners and house flags, and censer smoke billowed into the candlelit air. a procession of ministorum clerics carrying gilt standards and reliquary boxes, their long ceremonial trains supported by child servitors, shuffled down the main aisle towards the imperial shrine, where intendant banefail and master legislator anophy waited. there were hooded administratum officials in the procession and three astropaths from the guild, their satin-wrapped bulks bulging with tubes and pipes and feedlinks. the astropaths were carried on litters by adult servitors, and many of the tubes and pipes issuing from the folds of their cloaks were plugged to cogitator systems built into the silver-plated litter-pallets. a voice from behind gaunt asked. gaunt turned. it was kowle. kowle frowned, as if not convinced. gaunt nodded and the two grim, black figures in peaked caps strode together down the marble colonnade under the flickering ball-lamps strung along the walls. gaunt grunted. they strode under a high arch where banners flapped in the cool air. the choir echoed after them. kowle stopped short. gaunt stopped as well and turned back to face kowle. there was an immoderate darkness in the man's face. kowle nodded. general nash condemns our military organisations and says we are ill-equipped to deal with this fight. sturm rose. emotions run high. it is hard to say if a system is right or wrong until it is found wanting in the fire of battle. the vervun primary are exemplary soldiers, well-drilled and highly motivated. their bravery is beyond question. that our command channels clashed during today's engagement is simply unfortunate. it is not the fault of vervun officers. i have already issued standing orders to range the vox-channels so that there will be no further overlap. any deaths that have resulted from this misfortune are greatly regretted. gaunt's voice cut across the great hall and all the faces turned to look. gaunt walked to the end of the chamber and stepped up to the lectern. commissar kowle's actions are a matter of record. gaunt nodded. he wants his transfer badly, gaunt thought. he's supporting me every step of the way. gaunt faltered. tarrian of the vphc looked across at gaunt. gaunt looked away from the hooded eyes of the vphc commandant and found kowle's face in the throng. kowle smiled back at him, unblinking, soulless. he knew. he had known about grizmund even before they had reached the chamber. he had manoeuvred gaunt right into this trap. gaunt realised in an instant he had underestimated kowle's ambition. the man was after more than a simple transfer off verghast. asked anko. gaunt stepped away from the lectern and strode down the hall to the exit, yells and cat-calls showering over him. he looked down at the wiry off-worlder with his faded black fatigues and curious piebald cape. he was not impressed. all of the spoilers present, including ormon, carried long-barrelled autoguns with scopes dedicated to sniping. their faces were striped with bars of black camo-paint. several had fresh wounds bound tightly. sergeant mkoll called up his men so they could all study the chart. the ghosts grouped around the table, making comments, pointing. ormon said nothing. mkoll broke his men into work-teams and sent them away in different directions, though not before checking they had set their micro-beads to the same channel. ormon joined mkoll as the sergeant led his group of mkvenner, domor, larkin and rilke up shattered internal stairways to the third storey overlooking the slag heap. nine spoilers were stationed at the shattered windows up here, using scopes to watch the sleek slopes of the spoil. the ghosts took position amongst them. larkin and rilke, both armed with sniper-variant lasguns, set themselves up carefully. rilke used a length of pipe to disguise the end of his gun as it protruded from the wall. larkin covered his own gun down to the muzzle under loose sacks. domor took mkoll's scope, set it up on a tripod stand in the shadow of a window and linked his mechanical eyes to the sight. he could now see further and clearer than anyone in the fortification. ormon was about to ask mkoll a question when he realised he and the ghost called mkvenner had vanished. mkoll and mkvenner moved invisibly down the spoil slope, their capes spread over them. the coal-like ore-refuse was wet and slimy underfoot. they were outside the protection of the shield and the night rain fell around them, making puddles amongst the rock waste. they raised their scopes. beyond the spoil, two kilometres away, they saw the open, flat land and the blasted habs beyond. the heavy rain was creating standing water on the flat soil and the water was rippling like dimpled tin with the rainfall. visibility was down and cloud cover was descending. there was a sound. mkvenner armed his lasgun and mkoll crawled forward. it was singing. chanting. from out in the enemy positions, via loudhailers and speakers, a foul hymn of chaos was ringing out to answer the triumph hymns of the hive. it grew louder. mkoll and mkvenner shuddered. in the ore-works behind them, ormon felt his bladder vice and hurried away. at his position, larkin tensed. he was weary from the day's nerve-shredding battle and had only been sent in with mkoll's men because of his skills as a sniper. every time he closed his eyes, he saw the face, the face of the zoican. now, from below, down the length of the spoil, he could hear them. the zoican filth were singing a name over and over, in a canon repeat. heritor asphodel� an armoured lift cage with grilled sides transported gaunt down the last three hundred metres, lowering him into an underworld of dark, damp stone, stale air and caged sodium lamps. he entered an underground concourse where ground water dripped from the pipework roof onto the concrete floor and rusting chains dangled over piles of mildewed refuse. along one side was a row of wooden posts with shackleloops at wrist height.  the wall behind the posts was stippled with bullet pocks and darkly stained. gaunt approached an adamantine shutter marked with yellow chevrons. grizmund paused, then shrugged. grizmund nodded. loud footsteps, unpaced and overlapping, reverberated down the dank cell-block behind them. gaunt nodded to grizmund and walked over to the vphc group, facing tarrian for a moment. gaunt allowed himself to be marched out of the stockade. the thirty-third dawn was already on them, with heavy rain falling across the entire hive, the outer habs and the grasslands beyond. marshal croe was taking breakfast in his retiring chamber off the war-room when gaunt entered. the room was long, gloomy and wood-panelled with gilt-framed oil paintings of past marshals lining the walls. croe sat at the head of a long, varnished mahogany table, picking at food laid out on a salver as he read through a pile of data-slates. behind him, the end wall of the room was armoured glass and overlooked the commercia and shield pylon. because we need officers of grizmund's standing. because any punishment will send a negative message to the narmenian units and to all guard units as a whole: croe put down his fork and stared at gaunt as if he had just insulted croe's own mother. he rose to his feet, dabbing his mouth with a napkin. a vervun primary adjutant hurried into the retiring room behind gaunt. he held out a data-slate to the fuming marshal. croe snatched the slate out of the man's hands and read it quickly. what he read arrested his attention, and he went back and re-read slowly, his eyes narrowing. he looked round at croe. * * * gaunt and croe left the retiring room together and strode down the short hall into the great control auditorium of house command. both the lower level and the wrought-iron upper deck of the place were jostling with activity. hololithic projections of the warfront glowed upwards into the air from crenellated lens-pits in the floor, and the air throbbed with vox-caster traffic, astropaths' chants and the clack of the cogitator banks. a gaggle of munitorum staffers, vervun primary aides and technical operators hastened forward around the marshal as he entered, but he waved them all away, crossing to the ironwork upper deck, his boots clanging up the metal steps. vice marshal anko, general sturm, commissar kowle and general xance of the northcol were already assembled by the great chart table. silent servitors, encrusted with bionics, and poised regimental aides waited behind them. an occasional vox/pict drone bumbled across the command space. sturm fell silent. he reached for a cup of caffeine on the edge of the chart table, his hand trembling. kowle looked round at him. kowle conceded. he was one of the chief commanders nadzybar gathered in his great retinue to form the vast enemy force which overran the sabbat worlds, emperor damn him. despite the notoriety of the other warlords � filth like sholen skara, nokad the blighted, anakwanar sek, qux of the eyeless � heritor asphodel remains the most notorious. his sworn aim, both before and after archon nadzybar co-opted him into the pact, was to �inherit' imperium world after imperium world and return them to what he saw as the �true state' of chaos. his ruthlessness is immeasurable, his brutality staggering and the charismatic force of his personality as a leader cannot be underestimated. astutely, gaunt deferred to kowle, aware of how the commissar was bristling at what he would no doubt see as the colonel-commissar's grandstanding. kowle greedily accepted the scrap thrown to him. both generals nodded. the confusions of the last storm should not recur. asked xance. gaunt listened, fascinated. this was the first he had heard of xance's plan. clearly sturm, anko and croe had made efforts to suppress it. it could not be coincidence that xance was voicing it now in gaunt's presence. xance shook his head and left the upper auditorium without saluting. sturm looked over at gaunt with a scowl. corday smiled. the smile seemed genuine, despite the aristocratic languor of the face. rawne nodded, saluted and left the carriage. but for these bloody flies, ghost, i'd say we've pulled the best duty here! varl had already seen fighting in vervunhive and was actually glad of the calm and quiet up here on the far eastern side of the city. but still, waiting was sometimes the mind-killer. hell, no! worlin realised his hand was shaking and he was slopping joiliq out of the glass. he set it down and sucked the drops off the ball of his thumb. he checked his weapon was still in the drawer of the desk. this annoyance would need to be dealt with quickly. the chatter was now so persistent that there was no other sign or meaning to the world. salvador sondar spasmed gently in his fluid world, gnawing at his lips. the voice of his worthy ferrozoican cousin clatch had been whittled away until it simply repeated two words, over and again. a name. a daemonic name. sondar was emaciated and weak with hunger. his feeder tubes had long since run dry and he had not the presence of mind to cycle the automated systems to refresh them. even his meat puppets were forgotten and slowly rotting as they dangled lifelessly from their strings. a rich smell of decay filled the high master's chambers. he was oblivious. he knew what the chatter wanted. the notion appealed to him, because the chatter made it so appealing. he couldn't form a coherent thought. he simply listened. perhaps he would do it � just to shut the chatter up. any time now. larkin had been perfectly still for over an hour. his eye never left the scope-sight. the spoil-head manufactory around him was quiet and dark, but he was aware of the vervun sniper lotin crouched behind rubble further down the second-storey room. ten minutes before, larkin had sensed movement down on the spoil. he'd watched for it again and now he saw it: a brief flash of moonlight on armour. he retrained his aim. breathed. the zoicans were advancing up the spoil. they were well-drilled and as stealthy as any practised insurgency team. it was clear they had either switched their distinctive ochre armour for dull, night-fighting kit or had covered the livid yellow with soot. he signalled his intelligence to mkoll over the vox link, using only half a dozen code words. mkoll ordered the tanith snipers to address and fire when they had a target. a second later, ormon delivered the same command to his own men. larkin saw movement again, clearly in the foggy, green glow of his scope. he breathed, squared and fired. the stinging red pulse whipped down the ore slope and a black-clad figure was thrown up and backwards. larkin immediately dipped under the edge of the rubble and took a new position. he was certain his muzzle flash had been discreet, but there was no sense in advertising. he made his new vantage and aimed again, his extended barrel hidden inside a broken drain-gutter. lotin, ten metres away, fired. his lasgun made a loud crack and even from where he was, larkin saw the muzzle flash and cursed. he heard lotin complain over the vox-link. he'd missed. move, move and re-aim! larkin willed silently. lotin fired again. his whoop of success was quickly cut short by a perfectly aimed las-round from the spoil below. the zoicans had been watching for a repeat flash. lotin toppled back and slumped into the rubble scree on the floor, his face gone.  so, thought larkin, they have capable and careful snipers too. this war just got interesting. the night was on them now and the moons, two large and cream and one tiny and livid red, climbed slowly into a purple sky. rain clouds, black and woolly, chased along the eastern skyline. distant thunder rolled out in the grasslands. the air was sultry and unseasonable, and at hass east fort, varl was sweating freely into his black fatigues. the discomfort was made worse by the static build-up generated by the vast shield behind them, fizzing and crackling in the dark, a glowing hemisphere of energy. the plating of his lasgun and his bionic arm tingled with electricity. varl yearned for the threatening storm to break over them and clear the stifling air. there was a brutal flash from the north-east and then an ear-splitting bang, followed by an impact that threw varl off his feet. voices were shouting in the night, alarms were ringing and someone was screaming in agony. the sky lit up again. explosions were rippling along the entire stretch of curtain wall between ontabi gate and the hass. varl got up, blinking. there was no sign of shelling. that had been� mines. he ran down the parapet, yelling into his vox-link as more explosions shook the wall. detonating mines meant one thing only: the enemy was right on top of them, close enough to set charges. men were milling all around, confused. equally useless barks of vox-traffic answered varl. varl grabbed the wall for support as another explosion went off close by, flame slicking upwards in a tight ball inside the wall. inside the wall? he bellowed, not understanding it but desperate to get the message out. almost at once, he came under fire. las-shots flicked the air around him, coming up from the nearest wall access stair. varl returned fire, rallying the vervun primary troops nearest to him. crackling autoguns began to support him. he saw zoican storm-troops spreading out onto the battlements from the stair access, their ochre armour dulled by dark, tarry stains. varl shot down one or two before realising many more were storming the battlement behind him too. how in the name of feth had they got inside? a huge blast shook him to his knees. an entire section of hass east collapsed with a roar and brick dust billowed into the sky, underlit by flame. further detonations sliced through the top of the wall. varl saw gun emplacements ripped apart and exploded and he watched as entire sections of wall-defences blew outwards as mines set off ammunition silos and autoloader hoppers. like the wrath of a ruthless god, the war had come to hass east at last. �macharius, lord solar, from his writings distant thunder woke ibram gaunt from a dreamless sleep. his bedroom, part of a small suite of rooms disposed to him, adjacent to house command, was dark except for the dull amber glow of rune sigils on the small codifier by the desk. he turned on the lamp and slid off the bed where he had lain down only a couple of hours before, fully clothed. sleep had overtaken him in an instant. by the light of the lamp, he crossed to the desk, where stacks of ribbon-bound papers and dataslates were piled up. he took a sip of last night's wine from a glass on a side table. the thunder came again. somewhere, deadened by the thick walls, an alarm was ringing. he activated the call stud of the intercom set into the marble facing of the wall, blankly regarding the great framed portrait over the bare grate opposite. gaunt checked the clock. the suite's outer door slid open and gaunt went into the sitting room to meet his visitor, activating the wall lamps. a gnarled, elderly man in long, purple robes shuffled in, peering at gaunt through thick-lensed spectacles. his hair, where it protruded from under his high-crested, red, felt cap, was grey and unruly, and he leaned on an ebony cane. the man seemed wary of speaking. gaunt asked the advocate. pater cleared his throat. gaunt glanced round at bwelt. it may come to court. tarrian has a miserable record of dragging cases through all the due processes, even if he is bound to lose. tricky.  but the edict is well-precedented. a brief hearing, perhaps at dawn tomorrow, and we should be able to pull the rug out from under the vphc pater looked up at gaunt. even if they press for a court of their own, we can stall them as long as you refuse to participate. then � bwelt? again, you screw up your face! the� tribunal is in session now, advocate. come with me! now! varl yelled and the two officers began routing the surviving troops down a back staircase as firestorms billowed down the hallways towards them. rodyin bellowed as he and varl pushed man after man past them onto the stairs. rodyin didn't answer. on a section of wall below the mauled fort, corporal meryn was leading a straggle of panicking troops to cover. two squads of ghosts � brostin, ixjgris, nehn and mkteeg amongst them �pushed forward past him, but there were twenty or more vervun primary soldiers stumbling in their wake. meryn bawled at them, waving his arms, trying to be heard above the shriek of the shelling and the detonations all around. flames from the fort were reaching a hundred metres into the sky and billows of soot and burning fabric squalled around them. the heat was overwhelming. somewhere close, a loader full of ammo had caught fire and heated rounds were firing off wildly, spanking off the stonework and cutting zigzag tracer paths in the air. a shot hit the vervun primary trooper nearest to meryn and exploded his spiked helmet. there was a flash and some vast cutting beam drawn up outside the wall swept over them. meryn saw it and threw himself flat as the inexorable beam raked the parapet at chest height, vaporising the hurrying line of vervun troopers in a murderous sequence. they simply vanished in turn, obliterated, leaving nothing but clouds of steam and the occasional smouldering boot behind. the beam swept right over the prone tanith corporal, searing the back of his breeches, jacket and head-hair right off. he winced at the low throb of superficial burns, but he was startled to be alive. he got to his feet, his black fatigues shredded and falling off his body, and stumbled to the nearest stairhead. hundreds of men � tanith, roane and vervun primary � fled the wall fortifications and ontabi gate and ran for cover in the streets and habs adjacent to the docks. enemy shelling and beam-fire were punching clean through the wall and the fort structure now and blasting into the edges of the worker habs. the shield, ignited above them, mocked the scene. what good was an energy screen when the enemy was blasting through ceramite and adamantium? stretches of the habs were engulfed in flame and thousands of hab-dwellers filled the streets in panic, mingling with the fleeing soldiery, choking the access routes and transits in a panicked stampede. hass east fort convulsed and collapsed volcanically, the great hatches of ontabi gate melting like ice. a breach had been cut in the curtain wall of vervunhive more terrible and more extensive than any damage done so far, even than at the brutalised veyveyr railhead. at croe gate, the next main fortification down the curtain wall from hass east, some ten kilometres south of ontabi, the wall troops and observers watched in incredulous horror as beams of destruction and heavy shelling punished the riverside defences. a plume of fire underlit the storm clouds and blazed up into the sky like a rising sun. general nash was at croe gate still and he dismally voxed the situation to house command. he urgently requested significant reinforcements to his position. in the wake of a major breach like this, ground forces couldn't be far behind. as if on cue, one of his spotters reported movement on the vannick highway, twenty kilometres north-east. nash used his magnoculars on heat-see and gazed out at the shimmering, green phantoms of tanks and armoured vehicles, thousands of them, roaming towards ontabi in a spearhead formation. an almost eerie silence fell across the main auditorium of house command. only the desperate chatter of vox-traffic could be heard, reeling out reports of fearful destruction from a thousand different locations. his face pinched and pale, marshal croe looked down at the chart table on the upper level. hass east was gone. a mass armour force was approaching from the eastern levels. artillery was beginning to pound croe gate and the eastern wall circuit. zoican troops were assaulting the spoil and the defences at veyveyr.  heavy tanks and infantry columns were hitting sondar gate and the wall stretches towards hass gate and hass west fort. hass west fort itself was receiving ferocious ranged shelling. an attack on all fronts. the defences of vervunhive were already at full stretch and croe knew this was only the beginning. croe? what do we do, croe? croe struck anko across his fat mouth and sent him whimpering to the ironwork floor. croe looked across at sturm. he faltered. administratum pass level magenta� but the vphc are a law to themselves. they have their own lock codes. the weapon whined as he cycled it up to full power. he stabbed it at the armoured shutter. it rode aside, shrieking, leaving scratch marks and sending broken saw-teeth away in a flurry of sparks. he dug again and sliced into the metal, cutting a jagged slot a few centimetres across before the sword meshed and over-revved. he and his men approached and surrounded the quartet at the shutter. gilbear raised his hellgun, but sturm slapped it aside. i could do with a few men of your passion in my regiment. but still and all, you are a benighted fool and beneath the contempt of civilised men. you've spent too much time with those tanith savages and� what are you doing, this last remark was directed at pater, who was carefully and quietly dictating material for bwelt to set down on his slate. marshal croe has ordered me to release grizmund. the world is going all to hell above our heads, gaunt. zoica assaults on all fronts. it is time to forget all petty bickering. by order of the marshal himself, this court is overthrown. kowle rose too. kowle's face went purple with rage, but the furious tarrian pushed him aside. sturm can't control them and i sure as feth can't either. from me, you'll get tough honesty. gak you bawled tarrian as he pulled his autopistol from its holster. gilbear dropped him with a shot to the chest. tarrian's body exploded out through the back of the wooden seating. the vphc guards surged forward, racking riot-guns and firing. gaunt saw a blueblood fly backwards, hit in the shoulder. sturm was cursing and blasting with his regimental service pistol. the bluebloods opened up and sprayed the room. grizmund and his officers, blind under their hoods, dropped to the floor in terror. gaunt wrestled the gasping advocate and his stunned clerk to the ground out of harm's way. daur's laspistol cracked repeatedly.  point-blank, in the tight confines of the court chamber, volpone met vphc head on, hellgun against riot-gun, filling the air with smoke, blood-mist and death. salvador sondar slumped. a dribble of blood-bubbles fluttered from his ear towards the roof of the tank. he gave in. the chatter filled him, eating into his flesh, his blood, his marrow, his mind. he did what it told him to do. he deactivated the shield. � warmaster slaydo, on being asked under what circumstances he would signal surrender there was a loud, subsonic bang of pressure as the great shield collapsed. windows blew out all across the hive. the ambient temperature dropped by six whole degrees as the insulation of the energy dome vanished and the cold of the verghast night swept in. the vortex of collapsing air whisked up the vast smoke banks collected around the curtain wall and blew them into the hive itself like acrid fog. disconnected energies crackled up out of the great pylon and the anchor stations and burned themselves out ferociously in the blackness. a shuddering and terrifying noise drove in across vervunhive. it was the unified howl of triumph from the millions of zoicans outside. marshal croe, majestic in his robes and armour, had just reached sondar gate with his staff retinue, and he stopped in his tracks, gazing up incredulously into the cold dark. his first thought was mechanical failure or even sabotage, but the shield generators were the most securely guarded installations in the hive, and he had expressly ordered work-teams to inspect them every hour. this was unthinkable. inside the ceramite of his freshly donned war armour, croe felt his heart grow as cold as the night around him. the ungifted powersword of heironymo sondar, most valued of all the hive's war-icons, felt heavy and useless in his hand. he caught himself and glanced around. he was torn. he wanted to return to the main spine at once and cut to the root of this disaster, get the shield back on. it was sondar, he felt it in his blood. that bastard salvador had finally gone over the edge. but the immediate fight was here at the hive wall, in the face of the massing foe. his men had seen his arrival and if he turned around now, just as he had arrived, it would destroy their morale. the silence that had followed the ghastly massed howl of the zoicans outside, a silence that in truth could only have lasted a few seconds, was lost abruptly as the ear-splitting bombardment resumed. for leagues, the sky behind the towering shadow of the curtain wall that rose above him was lit yellow by the flare of colossal assault. croe saw a section of turret to the west of the gate explode and collapse down into the square of marshals in a shower of sparks and rubble. he took the tower steps two at a time at the head of his retinue, blazing the sacred sword into life, raging out orders to both the men around him and those unseen on the wall-top via his microbead link. one of those orders, direct and succinct, coded in house croe battle language, was for the ears of izak, croe's personal bodyguard. the big house warrior, clad in maroon body-armour, faltered at the foot of the tower steps and then turned back, curtly acknowledging his lord's command. he ran back across the square to the armoured stafftrack that had brought croe to sondar gate, and he steered it away at full throttle towards the main spine. alarms and klaxons began to whoop and wail once again. in the refuges and the camps of the commercia and the other open spaces of the hive, the multitude seethed in panic. they'd seen the shield fail. they'd fought their way to the security of the hive and now that too was gone. stampeding in places, two and a half million refugees began to surge north towards the river, the deluge of their bodies choking the streets. their vast numbers were quickly swelled by inner hab citizens, worker families and low guilders, who had all, in a brief few seconds, seen their protection from zoica disappear. in a matter of minutes, the hive was haemorrhaging people, rivers of panicking, screaming civilians, heading in hordes to a river they couldn't hope to cross. lord heymlik chass looked up from his scriptorium and gazed out of the ogee window. the stylus dropped from his trembling fingers and made a blot of violet ink on the pages of his journal. he got up, his ornamental chair tumbling over onto its back, and he stumbled across to the window, pressing his hands against the lead glass. his daughter burst into the room, still dressed in her nightgown, her terrified maids trying to wrap a velvet robe around her. outside in the hall. house chass lifeguards were shouting and running to and fro. lord chass turned and saw the look of jolted fear and bewilderment in his daughter's eyes. he took her in his arms. you will be all right, merity. they were terrified and half-dressed themselves. he was still buttoning on his ornate body-armour. his weapon was armed and unshrouded. he bowed. rudrec tucked the satchel inside the body of his flak-mail hauberk. you have served this house well. alone now, the hall outside thundering with footsteps and voices, chass put on his ceremonial robes, his bicorn hat, his shot-silk gloves. he was shaking, but most of that was rage. he put his ducal seal in his coat pocket, pushed the heavy code-signet ring onto his gloved finger, and slid a compact, single-shot bolt pistol with inlaid grips into his gown's inner sleeve. a handful of shells followed it. chass strode out into the corridor, stopping three of his lifeguards short. they saluted uncertainly. less than five minutes after the shield vanished, the first zoican shells began to wound the inner hive. it was as if their artillery, their earthshakers, their siege mortars, their missile positions had all been ranged ready, waiting. wave after wave of shrieking missiles screamed in over the curtain wall and hit the central district.  concussive ripples of explosions blew out along block after block, closing arterial routes with rubble, setting fires that blazed through dozens of high-rise habitat structures. thousands of habbers, either sheltering in their homes or fleeing through the streets, were obliterated or left crippled and helpless. siege mortar shells wailed in across sondar gate and punctured the stone concourse of the square of marshals. flagstone sections, whizzing like blades, were flung out, decapitating or mashing wall troopers from behind. the distinguished lines of statues edging the square were toppled by the blasts or disintegrated outright. mass shelling pounded the manufactories alongside croe gate. swathes of machine shops and warehousing caught fire, and the flames established a firm hold, licking west into the worker habs. similar shelling, supported by ground-to-ground rockets, began to systematically hammer the habs and manufactories behind hass west, and the impacts of their fall crept north into the elite sector. guild holdings and house ordinary estates were flattened and torn apart. the shelling and the dreadful cutting beams searing hass east scored a hole a hundred metres wide where the curtain wall and the ontabi gate had once stood, and as the beams redirected towards the inner habs and the upper stretches of the curtain, the zoican armoured column and massed infantry along the vannick highway pressed in through the breach. the zoican land forces made their first entry into vervunhive proper thirteen minutes after the shield came down, though the insurgent forces encountered by sergeant varl were, by then, well inside the hive. long-range shells � some two thousand kilos apiece, launched from railcars drawn up on hasty, makeshift trackways out in the southern grasslands � whistled and whooped as they dropped on the commercia and the mercantile suburbs. barter-houses blew out, their rich canopies igniting in sheets of flame as hot as the heart of a star. shockwaves crumpled others and the massive shells dug vast craters in the rockcrete footing of the hive. hundreds of thousands of refugees were still pressing to leave the commercial spaces. most died in the firestorms or were instantly obliterated by the shelling. some of the craters were five hundred metres across. shelling and missile attacks began to hit the vast main spine itself. in hundreds of places, the adamantine skin of the city-peak ruptured and holed. fires burned unchecked through nine or more levels. house nompherenti, on level 68, took a direct hit from a massive incendiary rocket and the entire noble lineage was immolated. they died frenzied, tortured deaths amid the furnace of tapestries, furniture and drapes in their exalted court. lord nompherenti himself, ablaze from head to foot, ran screaming for a hundred paces and toppled from the raised balcony of his banquet hall. his burning body, streaming a trail of fire like a comet, plunged fifteen hundred metres down onto the roofs of the central district. general xance, with a tattered vanguard of seven hundred northcol troops, was pushing through the firestorm chaos west of croe gate when pinpoint shells began to rip along his straggle of trucks and chimera troop carriers. vehicle after vehicle exploded, showering the street with metal debris, ignited ammunition and plumes of gushing fuel. northcol troopers fled the convoy to either side, dying in further shell-strikes everywhere they turned. xance's truck was overturned by a shell that struck the road alongside it. blacked out for a few seconds, the general found himself lying twisted in a mangle of ruptured wreckage and the bloody remains of his command team. there was a fine, dark drizzle in the air which he realised was a vapour of blood droplets. he tried to move, but pain gutted him. a transverse-gear rod had disembowelled him. he was half-buried in splintered body parts. he moved aside a fragment of leg that lay across his chest, coughing blood. then a limbless torso that still had the northcol insignia on its braids. then a severed arm. he gazed at it. it was his own. shells dropped all around, lighting the space with flashes so bright they burned out his optic nerves. they made no sound, not to him anyway. his eardrums had been punctured by the initial shell strike. blind and deaf, he could only sense the carnage around by the quaking of the ground and the shockwaves that buffeted at him. xance was almost the last of his seven hundred-strong unit to die. he had bled to death, howling in rage, before yet another shell vaporised him. in house command, vice marshal anko had fallen silent, his voice robbed to hoarse whispers by the screaming orders he had been issuing. he slumped across the great chart table as the command staff hurried around, stunned and helpless. the chart table made no sense anymore. runes and sigils flicked on and off, unable to keep up with the progress of the assault, wavering as contradictory data pummelled back and forth through the straining codifiers. after a while, it repeated nothing but default setting repeats of house crests. anko got up and backed away from the disingenuous table and its silence. he smoothed the front of his white dress uniform, adjusted the waist buckle under the girth of his belly and pulled out his autopistol. he shot the table eight times for disobedience, then changed clips and shot two of the aides who ran screaming from him. he tried to yell, but his voice was nothing but a feeble rasp. he ran to the ironwork rail and began to fire indiscriminately down into the lower deck, killing or wounding five more tactical officers and exploding a cogitator unit. vphc officer langana and two servitors tried to wrestle him to the ground. anko shot langana through the left eye and emptied the rest of his third clip into the mouth of one of the servitors, blowing the upper part of its head away. anko threw off the other servitor and got to his feet. he turned to face the great observation window, fumbling for another clip as the staff fled in panic all around. he saw the missile plainly, ft seemed to him he could even see the checkerboard markings around its nose-cone, though he knew that was impossible, given the speed at which it must have been travelling. even the fluting of the exhaust ducts, the rivets in the seams. the missile entered house command through the great window, slamming a blizzard of lead-glass inwards with its supersonic bow-wave before striking the rear wall and detonating. the storm of glass shards stripped vice marshal anko's considerable flesh from his bones a millisecond before the blast destroyed house command. a brace of earthshaker shells struck the great basilica of the ecclesiarchy east of the commercia. the two-thousand-year-old edifice � which had stood firm through the settlement wars, the colonial uprising, the piidestro/gavunda power struggle and countless bouts of civil unrest and rioting � shattered like glass. the roof was thrown outwards by the multiple blasts and millions of slate tiles showered the area for kilometres around, whizzing down like blades. stone walls, two metres thick, were levelled in the deluge of fire, flying buttresses sundering and bursting apart. precious relics almost as old as the imperium itself were consumed along with the priesthood. the streets outside were awash with rivers of molten lead from the roof and the windows.  many devotees of the imperial cult, citizens and clerical brethren alike, who had survived the initial impact hurled themselves into the building's pyre, their faith utterly destroyed. at croe gate, general nash tried to reform his beleaguered units and direct them north to the ontabi breach, even though fierce zoican attacks battered the gate position. house command was offline and there was no coordination of repulse. nash reckoned correctly he had 1,500 roane deepers and 3,500 vervun primary troops. he had been waiting for support from the northcol and xance, but he had a sick feeling it wasn't coming. the hammering of the shells was overwhelming. nash had been in the infantry since he joined the guard and he had seen the very worst dog-soldier work it had to offer. in those first few hours of the great assault, his command and leadership was unrivalled in vervunhive. he set a condensing resistance around croe gate that shut the invaders out, and he countermarched two thirds of his forces north to ontabi and the main breach, which was nothing short of overrun. nash's roane deepers, never the most celebrated regiment of the imperial guard, proved their worth that night at the eastern extremities of vervunhive's curtain wall. they met the zoican infantry pouring into the hive with determined marksmanship and hand-to-hand brutality. the deepers, despite their reputation for laziness and an easygoing attitude, stopped the inrush at ontabi dead for two and a half hours. a thousand roane � supported by and inspiring the vervun primary residue � took down almost 4,500 zoican troops and nearly a hundred armour elements. nash died in a work-hab ruin just before dawn, shot nineteen times as the zoicans finally broke his last-ditch defence and swarmed into the hive. falling back, the roane and vervun primary survivors continued to defend, street by street, block by block, as the zoican force rolled in on them. at sondar gate, zoican stormtroops raised ladders and siege towers to overrun the wall. marshal croe had lost count of the ochre-armoured soldiers he had slain by the time a massive death machine shaped much like a vast praying mantis thundered forward out of the night and hooked its huge arms around the towers of the sondar gate, ripping them apart. the great mantis-limbs locked and bridging plates extended between them, forming a huge ramp that allowed the zoican troops to finally overrun the battlements. croe fell as the vast limbs destroyed the entire frontage of the gate battlement. he was still alive in the rubble outside the collapsed gateway when advancing zoican troops passed in, bayoneting any living bodies they kicked. marshal croe died � broken, covered in dust and unrecognisable � with a zoican bayonet through his heart. gaunt snarled. the gunfire which had been shaking the martial court died away fitfully. the air reeked of laser discharge, cartridge powder and blood. vphc corpses littered the floor and the shattered wooden seating ranks. one or two bluebloods lay amongst them. gilbear growled and his men agreed loudly. the blueblood troopers began to herd the prisoners roughly out of the room. gaunt looked around the chamber. pater sat against the far wall, with bwelt fanning his pallid face with a scribeslate. daur was releasing the narmenian defendants. the room was a ruin. sturm's elite troops had slaughtered more than two thirds of the vphcers present in a brutal action that had lasted two minutes and had cost them three bluebloods. tarrian was dead, his rib-cage blasted open like a burned-out ship's hull. gaunt crossed to kowle. the commissar was sat on one of the lower seating tiers, head bowed, clutching a hellburn across his right bicep. kowle slowly looked up into gaunt's dark eyes. he said nothing, as there was nothing left to say. gaunt turned away from the disturbing beige eyes. he remembered bal-haut in the early weeks of that campaign. serving as part of slaydo's command cadre, he had first encountered kowle and his wretchedly vicious ways. gaunt had thought he embodied the very worst aspects of the commissariat. after one particularly unnecessary punishment detail, when kowle had had a man flogged to death for wearing the wrong cap-badge, gaunt had used his influence with the warmaster to have kowle transferred to duties on the south-west continent, away from the main front. that had been the start of kowle's career decline, gaunt realised now, a decline that had led him to the vervunhive posting. gaunt couldn't let it go. he turned back. don't lecture me. don't use my name like you're my friend. you're frightened of me because i have a strength you lack. it was the same on balhaut, when you were slaydo's lap-dog. gaunt opened his mouth in astonishment. gaunt laughed. kowle stood unmoving for a while, then tossed his pistol and insignia onto the floor. gaunt and sturm looked round. captain daur stood nearby, his face alarmingly pale. he held out a data-slate.  gaunt took the slate and read it, thumbing the cursor rune to scroll the illuminated data. he could barely believe what he was seeing. the information was already a half-hour old. the shield was down. massive assaults and shelling had punished the hive. zoican forces were already inside the curtain wall. gaunt looked across at grizmund and his fellow narmenians, flexing their freed limbs and sharing a flask of water. he'd come down here on a matter of individual justice and when his back was turned, hell had overtaken vervunhive. he almost doubted there'd be anything left to return to now at the surface. under the co-ordinated command of major rawne and colonel corday, the tanith and volpone units holding veyveyr gate staunchly resisted the massive zoican push for six hours, hammered by extraordinary levels of shelling. there was no ebb in the heedless advance of zoican foot troops and the waste ground immediately outside the gate was littered for hundreds of metres around with the enemy dead. along the ore-work emplacements at the top of the spoil, mkoll's marksmen and ormon's spoilers held the slag slopes with relentless expertise. mkoll voxed rawne when his ammunition supplies began to dwindle. both had sent requests to house command for immediate resupply, but the link was dead, and neither liked the look of the great firestorms seething out of the hive heartland behind them. larkin, holding a chimney stack with mkvenner and domor, had personally taken thirty-nine kills. it was his alltime best in any theatre, but he had neither time nor compunction enough to celebrate. the more he killed, the more the memory of the zoican's bared face burned in his racing mind. at the brunt-end of the veyveyr position, bragg ran out of rockets for his launcher and discarded it. it was overheating anyway. his autogun jammed after a few shots, so he moved down the trench, keeping his hefty frame lower than the parapet as las-fire hammered in, and he took over a tripod-mounted stubber whose crew had been shot. as he began to squeeze the brass trigger-pull of the thumping heavy weapon, he saw feygor spin back and drop nearby. a las-round had hit him in the neck. lesp, the field medic attending the trench, scrambled over to feygor, leaving a gut-shot volpone who was beyond his help. bragg yelled. lesp fought with the struggling feygor, clamping wet dressings around the scorched and melted flesh of his neck and trying to clear an airway. bragg fired a last burst or two and then dropped from the stub-nest and ran to feygor and the slender medic. it took all of his gargantuan strength to hold feygor down as lesp worked. the las-hit had cauterised the wound, so there was precious little blood, but the heat had melted the larynx and the windpipe into a gristly knot and feygor was suffocating. lesp threw the small, plastic-handled scalpel away in disgust and pulled out his long, silver tanith knife. he stuck it into feygor's throat under the blackened mass of the scorched wound and opened a slot in the windpipe big enough to feed a chest-tube down. feygor began breathing again, rattling and gurgling through the tube. lesp yelled something up at bragg that a nearby shell-fall drowned out. bragg hoisted feygor up in his arms without question and began to run with him, back down the lines. the tanith units that had held veyveyr two nights before pushed south from their temporary mustering yard as soon as the shield failed. corbec led them and sergeant baffels' platoon was amongst them. lacking orders from house command, corbec had agreed to move west while colonel bulwar's northcol forces moved east, hoping to reinforce the veyveyr and croe positions. in tight manufactory enclaves behind the once-proud veyveyr rail terminal, corbec's deployment encountered crossfire from the west. corbec realised in horror that while veyveyr might be sound, the enemy were pouring in through sondar gate unstaunched. he set up a scarifying resistance in a factory structure called guild githran agricultural and he tried to vox his situation to rawne or corday. corday eventually responded. it took a while for corbec to convince him that enemy forces, already in the inner hive, were in danger of encircling the solid veyveyr defence. they chose a window each, coughing in the dust that the bombardment was shaking up from the old floor boards. milo saw las-rounds punching through the fibre-board sidings of the broken building, and he heard the grunt-gasp of flamers. the enemy was right outside. from the windows, under baffels' direction, they fired at will. it was difficult to see what they were hitting. filain and tokar both yowled out victory whoops as they guessed they brought zoicans down. rhys, one window down from milo, stopped firing and sagged as if very tired. milo pulled round and called out to him, stopping short when he saw the bloodless las-hole in rhys' forehead. a falling shell blew out a silo nearby and the building shook. colonel corbec's voice came over the microbead link, calm and stern. level sub-6. gaunt nodded. he crossed to grizmund. it was the old hyrkan wavelength. sure. gilbear rasped, stomping forward. gaunt reached down with his hand to pull gilbear up. the big blue-blood hesitated and then accepted the grip. gaunt pulled gilbear right up to his face, nose to nose. they climbed the dim stairs as far as level low-2 and then found a set of cargo lifts still supplied with power. the massive spine shuddered around them, pummelled from the outside by the enemy. crowded into a lift car, the volpone checked weapons under gilbear's supervision. sturm stood aside, silent. gaunt crossed to daur and his prisoner. chass and isak looked round from the archway where they were sheltering and saw gaunt leading the team of blueblood elite down the atrium with silent precision. daur, kowle and sturm were at the back of the line, gilbear alongside the commissar. all weapons were drawn. he gestured to gilbear and the volpone moved three of his seven troopers round to cover the far side of the arch. he told isak and the bodyguard snarled through his microbead. gilbear and one of his point men bellowed the volpone battle-pledge at the tops of their lungs as they launched grenade after grenade in through the arch. the launcher mechanisms thumped and clacked as they pumped them. the blast, a series of explosions piled on top of one another, ripped back down the colonnade and blew out the galleries and the glass roof. debris and ash washed back through the arch. before the smoke even began to clear, the volpone stormed the room, yelling and firing. whatever else he thought about them, gaunt had to give the bluebloods their due. they were finely trained, ruthlessly effective heavy troops. he'd seen their worth on monthax. now they were proving it again. with his bolt pistol and chainsword drawn, gaunt ploughed into the colonnade after them, followed by isak and the croe guards, with daur and sturm left to assist chass. kowle simply wandered along behind. the place was a ruin. dismembered or support-severed servitors littered the wooden wreckage. one puppet, which had been standing on a now-collapsed balcony, swung above their heads like a corpse in a gibbet. asked chass suddenly swimming awake. the servitor came into the room through a doorway concealed by muslin drapes. sondar's macabre fascination with his meat-toys was infamous in the noble houses, and many efforts had been made to curtail his surgical whims and clone-farming over the years. this thing was far more than that, more even than the deluded creation of a mad flesh-engineer. the insanity of the warp was in it: eighteen hundred kilos of scarred meat and gristle, bigger than a hyrkan antlerdon, a jigsaw of human parts fused into the carcass of a wild auroch from the grasslands. limbs twisted and writhed around it, some human with grasping hands, some animal, some wet, glistening pseudopods like the muscular feet of giant molluscs. the massive head was an eyeless mouth full of needle teeth, that smacked slackly and gurgled. the donor auroch's vast horns swept outwards from the low skull crest. a multitude of cables, feeds and wires suspended it, but unlike the other meat puppets, this thing moved of its own volition, pawing and stamping the soft carpet, writhing and pulsing. the smell was overwhelming. gilbear and the volpone backed off a few paces in astonishment. sturm cried out in horror and one of the house croe bodyguards turned and ran. the meat-beast came for them, moving with a speed and fluidity that seemed impossible for something so vast. it howled as it came, a piercing, sibilant shriek of rage. gaunt leapt aside and was knocked over by a flailing pseudopod. the slime burned through his leather coat where it touched. gilbear fired twice, blowing open holes in the lower belly of the thing. these issued spurts of stagnant pus onto the carpet. then the blueblood colonel was flying through the air, tossed aside by a twist of the huge horns. backing frantically, the other volpone fired wildly. blubbery, wet punctures appeared in the creature's flank, some oozing filmy fluid, others erupting with sprays of tissue and watery blood. a cloned human arm was blown right off and lay twitching on the ground. a screaming volpone was hoisted into the air and shaken violently to death, impaled through the chest on one of the horns. another was crushed under the meat-beast's bulk, leaving a trampled mess of blood, bone and broken armour pressed into the carpet. grasping limbs and curling pseudopods caught hold of a third and began to pull him apart, slowly and inexorably. his agonised wailing drowned out the meat-beast's keening roar. gaunt scrambled up, dazed, and shot the clasped volpone through the head to end his drawn-out death. he fired again and again, until the sickle clip of his bolt gun was empty, the powerful close-range shots blowing chunks of raw meat and translucent fat out of the creature. blood and ichor spurted from the wounds. the monster wheeled round at gaunt, wailing. head down, it charged him and the horns, one still decorated with the limp corpse of the volpone soldier, smashed into the chamber wall, gouging the ceramite facing. gaunt dived aside, swinging his chainsword round with both hands. the purring blade sliced through the top of the skull and chopped one of the horns off. then gaunt was rolling away again, trying to stay out of reach of the biting maw that chased after him, drooling spittle. with its attention on gaunt, the meat-beast had turned away from the remaining volpone and they resumed firing, ripping into the thing's hindquarters but apparently doing nothing to slow it down. gaunt knew that daemonic force pulsed inside the beast, a life-energy that animated it beyond any considerations of physical function. if there was a brain or any vital organs at all, they would be useless as targets. the thing wasn't alive in any real sense. it couldn't be killed the way a human could be killed. daur was firing too now, as were the remaining house croe guards, and kowle had scooped up the weapon of a dead volpone, adding his own shots to the fight. chass was slumped limply in a corner, unconscious. there was no sign of sturm. gaunt hacked into the thing again, ripping through ribs. his chainsword was matted and clogged with the beast's fluid and tissue, and steam was rising from the blade where it was being eaten away by the toxic deposits. gaunt cursed. delane oktar, his old mentor, now long dead, had given him that sword on darendara, right at the start of his career, when he had still been green and eager. he had carried it ever since, all through his time with the hyrkans until his service under slaydo at balhaut, and beyond to tanith and every victory of his beloved ghosts. its destruction hurt him more than he could say. it took the past from him, took his memories and victories away. he jammed the dying blade into the beast's shoulder, kicking out a wash of toxic blood and bone chips. wedged fast, the sword disintegrated and the power unit in the grip exploded. gaunt was thrown backwards. the thing lunged down after him, biting at his kicking boots as he scrambled backwards on his backside. isak and two of the volpone surged forward, firing to cover him and draw the thing away. as it wheeled on them, gaunt found himself dragged clear. it was gilbear. blood flecked the front of his armaplas chestplate and there was rage in his eyes. he hauled gaunt back towards the green bulk of the iron tank. another volpone was caught by the beast's clamping jaws and shredded by savage bites of its teeth. the walls and drapes of the audience hall were sprayed heavily with blood now.  the creature turned on isak, snapping off his head and shoulders with one crushing bite. he had out his powerful sidearm, a long-barrelled autogun plated with chrome. he put shell after shell into the creature's neck. gaunt scrambled forward, retrieving his boltgun, and slammed a fresh clip into the receiver. he would kill this thing before he died. by the ghosts of tanith, he would. the meat-beast slew one of the remaining croe guards and flew at daur and kowle, trailing meat and blood from its mouth. both men stood their ground, exhibiting levels of bravery as high as any gaunt had ever witnessed. they pumped relentless shots into the approaching nightmare. nothing slowed it. hastily they both dived aside. daur rolled into chass' crumpled body and frantically tried to reload. kowle landed on a volpone corpse. gaunt bellowed. kowle was apparently fumbling with the dead blueblood's equipment belts. gaunt and gilbear fired again in a futile attempt to drop the thing. at the final moment, kowle turned and rose. he faced the rushing beast with his arms held out. he was clutching a canvas web of grenades. the meat-beast bit his arms off at the elbows and kowle tumbled backwards, blood jetting from the stumps. he didn't make a sound. the creature convulsed, retched and exploded from within. its massive torso blew out in a rush of flame and body matter. a spinning section of rib, thrown out by the blast, stuck quivering into the wall near gaunt like a spear. flames gouted out of the huge mouth. the beast collapsed onto the floor, pulling feed lines and wires out of the ceiling. the pool of stinking fluid spreading beneath it began to burn the carpet away. with gilbear behind him, gaunt crossed to the carcass. kowle, on his back in a widening circle of blood, was still alive. his voice so weak it was barely audible. balhaut� you were there at the victory, with the warmaster. i envy you. you� you took my honour away, you� ruined me. goodbye, commissar. gaunt saluted, a sharp, smart gesture he hadn't made in a long time. kowle smiled, barely, then died. daur nodded and began to raise the feeble verghast noble. gilbear joined gaunt at the tank. gilbear grinned. gaunt glanced round. it would take another ibram gaunt and a whole different universe for there to be any trust or comradeship between him and gilbear. but for now, in the thick of this nightmare, gaunt couldn't help respecting the soldier, for that was what he was: a devoted soldier of the god-emperor, just like gaunt. they didn't have to like each other to make it work. a measure of understanding and honour between them was enough. gaunt bent down to look through the port glass, and gilbear did likewise at his side. through the fog of murky, phlogistic fluid, they could just make out a frail, naked body, withered and corrupted, drifting inside the tank, its skull linked to wires and cables that curled upwards to the roof. gilbear smirked, arming the hellgun he had just retrieved. gilbear nodded and fired two shots through the portal window. filthy green water rushed out in torrents, flooding the floor. steam rose from it. gilbear leaned down once the force of the outrush slackened, and he watched the twitching, spasming form of the high master trembling in his draining tank. he fired a grenade in through the broken port and turned away. a dull crump and the sheet of steam that billowed out of the window hole marked the end of salvadore sondar, high master of vervunhive. daur had carried chass over to the brass console in the wall and he helped the enfeebled lord punch in the override settings. chass mumbled the codes to daur just in time. the noble was dead by the time gaunt reached them. the runic sigils on the console plate asked for a noble geno-print. asked daur. automated systems cycled and whirred. deep in the bowels of vervun-hive, field batteries throbbed. the pylon crackled and the anchor stations that remained intact raised their masts. with a resounding, fulminating crack and a reek of ozone, the shield was reignited. ibram gaunt left the audience hall of house sondar and walked up onto an enclosed roof terrace that overlooked the entire hive. fires burned below, thousands of them, and streaks of constant shelling lit the air. the shield overhead glowed and crackled. now the last ditch had begun. �general coron grizmund, at the start of the narmenian counterattack overnight, between the thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth days of the war, vervunhive had come to the brink of destruction. now, like a clenching muscle, the imperial forces tightened and backed through the inner habs and elite sectors, resisting the encircling foe. for all their massive numbers, the zoicans could only attack by land with the shield reactivated. the dense streets, city blocks, habitats and thoroughfares favoured the defenders, who could dig in and hold the zoican push. corday and rawne dragged their forces back from veyveyr into the worker habs a bare half hour before they could be encircled by enemy forces reaching upwards from sondar gate. northcol and vervun primary battalions pushed west to support the retreating roane, still resisting street by street as they fell back from the croe and ontabi gates. colonel bulwar had nominal command of that front.  five thousand vervun primary troopers under captain cargin still held the hass west fort fast, though looping columns of zoican infantry were beginning to bracket them through the chemical plant district. throughout the inner habs south of the main spine, imperial units tried to stem the advance. sergeant bray directed the tanith in the wastes north of the chem district. volpone, northcol and vervun primary sections strung out to his east, where corbec's remaining tanith and a force of roane deepers under major relf had consolidated a wide area of manufactories. the fighting there was thick, as thick as any in the hive. guild githran agricultural had been held since the small hours of the morning. corbec's platoons had precious little ammo left and no food. they had been fighting all-out for six hours straight. enemy flamer-tanks holding the north-south arterial highway rightly were preventing the tanith from obtaining munitions from the better-provided roane, just half a kilometre away to the east. the tanith were forced to scavenge for ammo, running out of cover in twos and threes to loot the fallen zoicans. at least with the shield reactivated, they were spared the worst of the shelling, though the enemy armour and field pieces now set up inside the shield dome were unrelenting. baffels whistled a command, and milo, neskon and cocoer dashed from the cover of a derelict abattoir and scurried towards a burning textile mill. dremmond covered their run with spurts from his flamer. the three tanith had bayonets fixed. they were all out of ammo, except cocoer, who had only a handful of shots left. six zoicans lay dead behind the rear wall of the mill. the trio descended on them and stripped them of las-cells. each corpse had six or seven as well as musette bags filled with stick grenades. milo looked up. the air throbbed with las-fire and though the shield had shut out the rain, the ground was slick and muddy. me pulled neskon down into cover. enemy fire chased down the mill wall, cracking holes in the plaster facing and puffing out brick dust. a fireteam of zoican stormtroopers was advancing through the ruins to the west of the mill. cocoer now had a fresh clip in his guard-issue weapon and he fired twice, missing his targets but causing the zoicans to duck and cover. milo added urgently. they could hear the crunching footfalls of the zoicans barely ten paces from their cover. loud las-shots cracked over the ruins, single shots, high-powered. baffels squawked. milo led the way, neskon and cocoer on his heels. he got a glimpse of the zoicans behind him, sprawled dead from clean head-shots. milo smiled. the trio slid into cover in the agricultural manufactory, safe behind a solid ceramite wall. baffels and other tanith crowded round them as they shared out the clip-cells and the stick-bombs. milo looked across the roofless factory-space and saw larkin dug in high up near a vent hatch. the tanith snipers, along with the spoilers, had drawn back from the spoil. milo had known that the precision killing of the zoicans had been the work of marksmen. he flashed a grin up at larkin. the weasely sniper winked back. milo handed a cell to baffels. corbec looked up out of the loophole he was holding, his shaggy head coated in soot and grime. corbec got up and slapped mkoll on the arm. took a while to convince them that falling back was the smart choice. they'd have held the slag-slopes forever. grimaced corbec. mkoll nodded. he pointed out the leader of the spoilers, a bulky man with bloodshot eyes who was doing most of the shouting and cursing. corbec sauntered over to the big verghastite. no sign of support. i've been trying the vox. rodyin pointed out across the depot to the series of vast fuel-pipe routes that came in over the river on metal stilt legs from the northern hinterlands. snapped varl. rodyin shrugged. somehow the information aggravated him. it was way too fething late to find out how they had been breached. the fight at hand took his mind off it. persistent rocket grenades were tumbling onto them from a loading dock at the edge of the depot.  varl ordered a pack of roane down to establish covering fire and then sent brostin in with the flamer. he edged the rest of his men along down the devastated depot roadway, sometimes using the litter of metal plating and broken girders as cover, sometimes having to negotiate ways over or around it. a fuel lank sixty metres away blew out with huge, bright fury. logris, meryn and nehn, working forward with a handful of vervun primary troopers, almost ran into a zoican fireteam in a drain-away under one of the main derrick rigs. the tanith laid in fearlessly with bayonets, but the vervunhivers tried to find room to shoot and several were cut down. hearing the commotion over his microbead, varl charged in with several other tanith, spiking the first ochresuited soldier he met with his silver bayonet. another sliced at him with a boarding hatchet and varl punched his head off with one blow from his metal arm. major rodyin came in behind, shooting his autopistol frantically. he seemed pale and short of breath. varl knew that rodyin had never been in combat like this before. in truth, the man had never been in combat at all before that day. three desperate, bloody minutes of close fighting cleared the drain-away of zoicans. logris and nehn set up solid fire positions down the gully, overlooking the dock causeway. rodyin took off his glasses and tried to adjust the earpieces with shaking hands. he looked like he was about to weep. varl asked. he knew full well rodyin wasn't, but he suspected it had less to do with combat shock and more to do with the sight of his home city falling around him. varl could certainly sympathise with that. nearby, corporal meryn laughed. the notion seemed to please rodyin. he was wearing bulky fuel-worker's overalls in place of the tanith kit which had been scorched off him. his seared scalp was caked with dried blood and matted tufts of scorched hair. varl said nothing. he'd rather have stayed put or even fallen back a little to consolidate. the last thing they wanted was to overreach themselves, yet rodyin was determined. varl was uneasy following the major, even though the verghastite had rank. but willard was dead � varl had seen his burning body fall from the wall � and there was no one of authority to back him up. so they moved east, daring the open firestorms of the docks, winning back vervunhive a metre at a time. * * * general grizmund walked down the steps of the main spine exit, adjusting his cap and powersword. wind-carried ash washed back across the stone terrace of the commercia where the narmenian tanks were drawn up: one hundred and twenty-seven main battle tanks of the leman russ pattern, with twenty-seven demolishers and forty-two light support tanks. their engines revved, filling the air with blue exhaust smoke and thunder. grizmund nodded. he and the other officers liberated by gaunt from the hands of the vphc were more than ready to see action. grizmund pulled his command officers into a huddle and flipped out the hololithic display of a data-slate. a threedimensional light-map of the commercia and adjacent districts billowed into the sooty air. grizmund began to explain to his commanders what he wanted them to do, how they would be deployed, what objectives they were to achieve. his voice was relayed by vox/pict drones to all the narmenian crews. his briefing turned into a speech, a rousing declamation of power and victory. at the end of it, the tank crews, more than a thousand men, cheered and yelled. grizmund walked down the line of growling tanks and clambered deftly up onto his flag-armour, the grace of the throne, a long-chassis russ variant with a hundred and ten-centimetre main weapon. like all the narmenian vehicles, it was painted mustard-drab and bore the imperial eagle crest and the spiked fist sigil of narmenia. it felt like coming home. grizmund dropped down through the main turret's hatch, strapped himself into the command chair, and plugged the dangling lead of his headset into the vox-caster. grizmund tested the vox-link and made sure he had total coverage. he pulled the recessed lever that clanged the top-hatch down, and he saw his driver, gunner and loader grinning up at him from the lower spaces of the tank hull. the narmenian tank units roared down through the commercia and back into the war. house command was a molten ruin full of scorched debris and a few fused corpses. the blast that had taken it out had also blown out the floor and disintegrated the main spine structure for three levels below. gaunt viewed it from the shattered doorway for a minute or two. searching the adjacent areas, gaunt appropriated a ministorum baptistry on level mid-36 as a new command centre. under daur's supervision, workteams cleared the pews and consecration tables and brought in codifiers and vox-systems liberated from dozens of houses ordinary on that level. gaunt himself hefted a sheet of flakboard onto the top of the richly decorated font to make a desk. he began to pile up his data-slates and printouts. ecclesiarch immaculus and his brethren watched the imperial soldiers overrun their baptistry. it was one of the few remaining shrines in the hive still intact. they had been singing laments for the basilica when gaunt arrived. immaculus joined gaunt at his makeshift desk. the old man in long, purple robes shook his head wearily. the cleric had been nothing but gracious and gaunt was anxious to show his appreciation. immaculus nodded, leading his brethren up to the celebratory, from where their plainsong chants soon echoed. gaunt viewed the data-slates, seeing the depth of the destruction. he made note marks on a paper chart of the hive. daur brought him the latest reports. xance was dead; nash too. sturm had vanished. as gaunt surveyed the lists of the dead, major otte of the vervun forces, the lord marshal's adjutant, arrived in the baptistry. he was wounded and shellshocked, one of the few men to make it clear of the fall of sondar gate. gaunt stood up and solemnly received the salute with one of his own. what he had suspected ever since he led the assault on sondar's lair was now confirmed: he was the senior surviving imperial officer in vervunhive and so overall military authority was now his. all senior ranks, both local and off-world, were dead or missing.  only grizmund held a rank higher than gaunt and armour was always subservient to an infantry command. otte presented gaunt with croe's sword of office: the powerblade of heironymo sondar. whoever leads vervunhive to war must carry the sword of heironymo. gaunt accepted, allowing otte to formally buckle the carrying sash around him. intendant banefail of the administratum, surrounded by a procession of servitors and clerks, entered the baptistry as otte was performing the ceremony. he nodded to gaunt gravely and accepted his authority without question. the first of the vox-links had just been set up and daur brought him a speaker set. adjusting his channel setting, gaunt raised the commander of north-col armour groups milling in confusion south of the commercia. he directed them down towards sondar gate. then he began to systematically contact all the tattered sections of infantry and guard. gaunt spent the next ten minutes voxing tactical instructions to dozens of individual troop units throughout the hive. he was unable to reach varl or any unit north of the main spine. as he worked, servitors and staff officers tracked the substance and matter of his battle-plan on a hololithic chart of the city, overlaying it with any data they received from the ground. for a short while, gaunt toyed with the settings of the vox-unit, hunting through the bands to locate the low frequencies the zoicans were using. he still hoped they might intercept and unscramble the zoican transmissions and eavesdrop on their tactical command net. but it was futile. the zoican channels were seething with transmissions, but all in that incomprehensible chatter, the chatter that defied translation even by linguistic cogitators, a constant, meaningless stream of corrupt machine noise that gave up no secrets. either that, or the chanting repeats of the heritor's name on the propaganda wavelengths. gaunt had fought chaos long enough to know not to call in human scholars or astropaths to try to decode the chatter. he couldn't allow that filth to taint any mind in vervunhive. a commotion at the door roused gaunt from his work. a detail of vervun primary soldiers was escorting general sturm into the baptistry. sturm croaked. the room fell silent around them and all eyes turned to observe the confrontation. gaunt walked around sturm, looking out at the watching faces with interest. no one showed any sign of leaping to the general's defence. you're a disgrace. a coward � and a murderer. you know damn well it was your orders that killed five hundred of my tanith on voltemand. gaunt stared into sturm's blinking eyes. gaunt shrugged. he's condemned you all to death by fire. i'm glad to be out of it. captain daur screamed. gaunt swung around, the powersword of heironymo sondar already out and lit in his hand. it sliced through sturm's wrist before the volpone general could fire the bolt gun � the bolt gun that had been aimed at gaunt's skull. sturm fell sidelong on the baptistry flagstones, shrieking out as blood pumped from his wrist stump. nerves spasmed in his severed hand and the bolt pistol fired once, blowing a hole through the ornate prayer screen behind gaunt. gaunt glared down at the general's writhing form for a moment. gaunt's command post in the main spine had contacted and tactically deployed almost two-thirds of the available fighting strength in the hive, a feat of determined efficiency that left both the administratum and the surviving officers of the vervun primary strategic planning cadre dumbfounded. what made it altogether more extraordinary was that gaunt had driven the work almost single-handedly. after the incident with sturm, he worked with an intense devotion that was almost terrifying. latterly, as the cohesion of his plan became clear, he was able to delegate work to the eager tactical staffers, but the core of the resistance plan was his alone. ban daur stepped out of the baptistry a little after midday to clear his head and find water. he stood for a while under a blackened arch at the end of the hallway, watching through glassless windows as flickering areas of warfare boiled through the dense streets below. captain petro, one of the tacticians, emerged from the baptistry too and came to stand with daur, an old friend from their academy days. petro nodded. at a crossroads designated fg/567, in the heart of the eastern central habs, bulwar's infantry divisions were close to breaking. they had no anti-armour ordnance left and the zoican tank thrust was burning a spearhead through from croe gate, laying waste to hectares of habitat structures. bulwar and his northcol battlegroup moved south around the crossroads, tackling zoican troops in the rockcrete tangles that had once been labour-homes. tank rounds screamed down over them, blowing out sections of wall and roadway, collapsing precarious spires of rubble and masonry. in the shell of a funicular carriage station, between the ornate marble pillars and the old brass benches, they fought at close quarters with a phalanx of zoicans. more were pouring in through the ticket booths at the far end or climbing up into the station through the shattered wreck of a carriage train that had made its last stop at the platform. civilian dead lay all around. bulwar led the attack, breaking body armour with his power claw and shooting with his autogun. men fell around him, too many to count. a las-round struck his shoulder and he was thrown backwards off his feet. when he got up, things had changed. a fighting force had erupted into the station from the passenger exits and it was tearing into the zoicans from the side. they weren't northcol or vervun primary or even guard. they were workers, hive labourers, armed with captured guns, axe-rakes, or any other weapon they could find. he'd heard of many emerging from the ruins to assist the imperial forces, but not one of this size and organisation. their vengeful fury was astonishing. the frenzied fighting lasted about eight minutes. between them, bulwar's platoon and the workers killed every zoican in the station precinct. there was cheering and whooping, and northcol troopers hugged vervunhivers like lost brothers. a short, thick-set worker with one eye, bedraggled in muck and blood, limped over to bulwar and saluted. bulwar couldn't help smiling. the worker boss had a general's pins, fashioned out of bottle caps, sewn into his jacket. soric frowned. bulwar called up his vox-officer and called in the details of soric's irregulars. he looked to soric. soric was already pulling his makeshift rank pins off. enemy tanks! bulwar and soric scrambled over to the station's east entrance to see. the huge shapes of zoican storm-tanks, long-barrelled and heavily armoured, were scything in towards the station and the surrounding habs.  others, including fast-moving light assault tanks and squat, super-heavy flamer platforms, were pushing round onto the transit streets leading to the commercia and the shield pylon. � against tanks? soric frowned. twenty-four, of course. lord commander? merity chass looked up into gaunt's tired eyes fretfully. she glanced around at him sharply. gaunt shrugged. he pulled off his gloves and tossed them aside. her eyes, more alive than anything gaunt had ever seen, gazed into his. caffran cried at dalin, pressing the swaddled baby into the boy's arms. caffran glanced back confused and then ran on as lasbursts flickered around him. good shots. tona swung round to him, her face hard. cargin/hass west to baptistry command. cargin sighed. he was about to tell baptistry command he had less than a thousand men left, most of them wounded, at the end of their ammo supplies, with no artillery support, and an ocean of enemy on all sides. he was about to estimate they could hold on another hour at the most. the estimate would have been inaccurate by fifty-nine and a half minutes. anglon grabbed cargin's arm, shouting out as fierce lights blinked and fizzled in dark recesses down the centre of the pyramid side facing them. the vast zoican vehicle shuddered and then retched huge, searing beams of plasma energy at hass west fort: cutting beams, like the ones that had dissected ontabi gate, but larger still and far more powerful, energy weapons of a scale usually seen in the fleet engagements of naval flagships. the roar was deafening, sending out a shockwave that was felt kilometres away. hass west fort and the gate it protected were obliterated.  cargin, anglon and all the remaining defenders were disintegrated in one blinding instant. as the cutting beams faded, rocket and gunnery platforms all across the pyramid opened fire and piled destruction on the ruins. the air stank with ozone and static and fycelene. for half a kilometre in each direction, the curtain wall collapsed. the pyramid machine began to trundle forward again, inching towards the dying hive, blaring the heritor's name over and again. gaunt woke with a start, his mind spinning. sleep had taken away his immediate fatigue, but every atom of his body ached and throbbed. it took him a moment to remember where he was. how long had he been asleep? he clambered to his feet. the sacristy was chilly and silent, the ecclesiarch choir long since finished. merity chass stood nearby, gazing at the friezes of the imperial cult. she wore his long overcoat and nothing else. she looked round at him and smiled. gaunt recovered his shirt and boots and pulled them on. he could still taste her on his lips. he stared at her for a moment more. she was � beautiful. if he didn't have a reason to fight for vervunhive before, he did now. he would not allow this girl to perish. he sat down on the pew and laughed to himself dryly. gaunt shook his head. such thoughts! he had committed the cardinal sin of any good officer. he'd placed his emotions in the firing line. even now, he could hear oktar's dirty chuckle in his mind, scolding him for becoming attached to anyone or anything. gaunt buttoned his shirt. he realised, perhaps for the first time, that he had broken with oktar's advice a long time since. when he had met the tanith and had brought them as ghosts from the deathfires of their world, he had started to care. he decided he didn't see it as a weakness. in that one thing, old oktar had been wrong. caring for the ghosts, for the cause, for the fight, or for anyone, made him what he was. without those reasons, without an emotional investment, he would have walked away or put a gun-muzzle in his mouth years before. gaunt got to his feet and found his cap, his gloves and his weapon belt. he was trying to remember the furious notions that had woken him. gaunt crossed to merity. sorry, sir forget it, ban. gaunt growled. they strode into the bustle of the baptistry command centre. additional cogitators and vox-sets had been added over night. over three hundred men and women from vervun primary, the administratum and the guilds now crewed them, working in concert with dozens of servitors. intendant banefail and members of his elite staff assisted the major. many saluted as gaunt entered the chamber. he acknowledged the greetings while taking in the details of the main hololithic display. gaunt spotted the marker on the display. banefail joined them. the distinguished lord was almost dead on his feet with fatigue. gaunt glanced at the woman operating the set. she dialled up the speaker and the air filled briefly with the coded, incessant growl of the enemy. gaunt tried not to look at him and the festoon of data-plugs stapled into his translucent scalp. the astropath lifted a bionically augmented, wasted limb and pointed to data runes flashing across the instrumentation. banefail glanced around at the name. gaunt forced himself to look at the astropath. stammered otte. he gestured to the hololithic display. the amulet gurgled and quivered. this could work, thought gaunt. god-emperor save us, this could fething work! the ghosts and scratches fanned out and made ready, arming weapons freshly supplied for the mission. a fireteam of ten volpone advanced down the side street, led by colonel gilbear. they were all volpone elite troops from the 10th: massive, carapace-armoured and holding hellguns ready. gaunt walked out into the rubble-strewn open to meet gilbear. they saluted each other. gilbear said archly. gaunt crossed to rawne and kolea as the volpone meshed into the column spread. rawne spat in the puddles and made no reply. may i ask what the gak you're doing here? gaunt gestured to the scout sergeant. correct. gaunt shrugged. troops? kolea smiled, but without any light or laughter in his face. bragg, his missile launcher and autocannon slung over his shoulders, raised his eyebrows and made no reply. there were eight females in kolea's scratch company, none older than twenty-five. each held a captured zoican lasgun or a vervun primary autorifle and carried an equipment pack over their ragged work fatigues. most of them, like the men, wore salvaged military boots wadded with socks and wrapped tight with puttees made of cargo tape to keep them fast. the women moved as silently and as surely as their male comrades. a month of intense guerrilla war in the outhabs had trained them well. those that had not learned had not made it. dremmond hissed, lugging his flamer with its weighty, refilled tanks. some of the other scratches nearby laughed. mkvenner nodded. he signalled back and gaunt sent domor forward. haller helped domor lock his sweeper set together, and then the ghost began to creep away from them, playing the head of the broom back and forth over the dirt. domor liked to do this work by sound and mkvenner smiled to see him dosing the shutters of his bionic ocular implants by hand. the time when domor could simply close his eyelids was long passed, way back on menazoid epsilon. domor had a path cleared in under five minutes, playing out a fibre-cord to mark its zigzag path. by the time he had finished, the assault force had caught up with them and were waiting with mkvenner, haller, nessa and bonin at the fence. asked haller, pointing over at domor on the far side of the area. single file, the eighty soldiers crossed the ex-artillery emplacement and moved down along a reinforced walkway that crossed one of the hive's main drainage gullies. swollen by the heavy rains, the gully was in full flood. it was partially dammed in places by slews of debris rubbish and bundles of corpses. up the other side, they climbed the chute slope by a metal stairway and hurried in small packs across another highway. the ruined remains of bodies littering the road stretched as far as the eye could see. most tried not to look. larkin stared in horrified fascination as he crossed the road. nothing more than bundles of rags, the bodies were those of workers and habbers slaughtered as they had tried to flee inwards towards vervunhive. they had fallen weeks before, and no one had touched or moved them, except tire mashing tracks of zoican war machines heading north towards their target. gaunt called a halt-period in the broken habitats on the far side of the highway. his motley brigade set up defence watches all around as he climbed to the third storey of a hab block with kolea and gilbear. he moved ahead, down the dirty, dank hallway, his weapon raised, and kicked open the rotting door of a worker flat. gaunt and kolea, weapons ready, moved in behind him. all three stopped short. the flat was thick with trash and overrun with vermin. the smoke issued from a small fire set in a tar bucket over which swung a metal pot on a wire frame that had once been a clothes hanger. the five inhabitants of the room, a mother with three children and a much older woman, cowered in the far corner. they were emaciated and filthy, just terrified skin and bone clad in dirty tatters. gaunt told kolea and gilbear, though kolea needed no urging. the shank remained pointing at him. he pulled a wad of ration cakes from his pack and went over, dropping them on the floor in front of the group when the mother refused to take them. rawne voxed back an acknowledgement. it took half an hour for the zoican column to go by. gaunt estimated there were a little over two thousand foot troops and sixty armoured vehicles � reserves, advancing to bolster the assault. he wished to the emperor himself he had reserves of such numbers to call upon. feth, he wished he had such strengths in his active units! once the column was safely past and clear, the operation heironymo assault cadre left the habitats and moved on through rain-swilled ruins, towards the spike. the closer they got, the bigger it grew, dwarfing all the building structures around. larkin bit back deep unease � it was big, so fething big! how in the name of feth were eighty souls going to take on a thing that size? they were cowering in rubble. let's get ahead and find a suitable habitat overlook � unless it changes course. larkin stammered in relief. gaunt grinned. at a time like this, he hardly minded mad larkin's informality. get a grip! get a grip! muril swung around and grabbed the edge of an armour plate, digging her fingertips into the seam. as soon as she was secure, haller let go and slid down beside her. he didn't dare voice his relief. for a moment, he had been close to dropping them � or being pulled away with them. gaunt's unit, forty bodies, clung to the sloping side of the gigantic zoican war machine and slowly began to climb up it.  the spike's pyramid form was punctuated by shelflike terraces, like some step-temples of antiquity gaunt had once seen on fychis dolorous. the soldiers crawled up over the lip and made themselves fast on the nearest horizontal shelf. the progressing spike, oblivious to the human lice now adhering to its hide, moved on and slammed over and through the hab block where gilbear's team was waiting. gaunt watched in horror as the metal slopes demolished a large chunk of the hab's lower storeys. then he saw gilbear and his team leaping down from a far higher level. they'd clearly moved up a floor or two when the impact of the spike's course had become evident. the troopers, led by gilbear, dropped far further than gaunt's unit had done. they impacted on the hull above the shelf gaunt and the others occupied, and most slid down onto that safe landing. some clung on where they found purchase on the slopes above. two � a volpone and the tanith scout bonin � bounced away like rocks down a mountainside and dropped past gaunt, disappearing a hundred metres below under the lip of the hull. gaunt looked away. if the sheer fall hadn't killed them outright, they were dead under the massive caterpillar carriage. gaunt signalled around and made contact with the remaining troopers. they were all rendezvousing on the shelflip. the curtain wall of vervunhive was now only minutes away and their time was disappearing fast. weapons ready, reaching out hands to steady themselves against the motion of the spike, the strike team followed gaunt down the shelf. the difficult part remained: how to find a way inside this armoured monster. the hull was solid. gaunt sighed. they could blast or cut the hull open if there was a chance of accessing a hollow space within, but domor was positive. it stood to reason a machine like this would be thick-skinned. two of gilbear's volpone returned along the shelf from scouting the far end. gaunt notified the squad leaders and led the single-file team along the shelf. they were about to make the turn onto the forward face when the beam weapons fired again. the light flash was even more brutal out in the open and the sucking roar monstrous. the whole spike shook. kolea asked, shaming them all. always, always lead from the front. never expect a man under your command to undertake an action you're not prepared to make yourself. it was one of delane oktar's primary rules, drummed into gaunt during his years with the hyrkans. he was not about to forget his mentor's advice now. gaunt led the way around the corner of the hull and hurried towards the huge, main-weapon recesses below him. visor hatches the size of the sondar gates were pulled up from the ports like eyelids. the air was sweet and tangy with burnt plasma and fluorocarbons. gaunt reached the edge of the emplacement recess and grabbed hold of one of the shutter stanchions, a heavyweight hydraulic limb at full extension. his leather glove slid off the oiled, shining metal. he pulled the glove off and took hold with his bare hand, arming his bolt gun in the other. gaunt leapt and let himself fall, swinging down and around like an ape by one hand. using his body weight's pendulum momentum, he threw himself in through the weapon hatch, letting go of the hydraulic limb at the same moment. he fell, rather than jumped, inside the hull, landing and stumbling on a grilled cageway that ran alongside the massive snouts of the beam cannons. rolling, he saw two black-clad zoican gunners leap up from their firing consoles, and he shot them down. three zoican soldiers in full battledress charged up onto the cageway, blasting at him. gaunt lost his footing and fell, the las-shots screaming over his head. the shots blew apart the torso of the volpone leaping in behind him and threw his corpse back and outwards so it fell away down the slope of the hull. recovering, gaunt resumed firing, aiming precise head-shots at the zoicans, exploding their full-face helmets with high-explosive rounds. then gilbear, mkoll and three other tanith had made it inside behind him. mkoll opened up with his lasrifle, supporting gaunt's fire-pattern, and gilbear turned back to pull others of the strike force in through the huge awning. gaunt and mkoll advanced with crothe and rilke, partly to secure the weapon deck and partly to make room. the commissar and his three tanith troopers scoured the gun-control position, blasting dozens of zoican personnel. within moments, the zoican troopers set up a flaying return of fire. crothe was blasted off his feet and mkoll took a hit in his hip. he slammed back into the wall and fell, but somehow maintained his fire rate. now gilbear and three of his elite blueblood were coming in behind, laying down a field of fire with their hellguns. behind them on the cageway, haller and kolea were dragging the other squad members in through the hatch. gilbear's fire team advanced and secured the gunnery deck behind the colossal beam emitters, slaying everything that moved. the air in the chamber was dense and rich with gunsmoke. the grilled deck was strewn with zoican dead. somewhere an alarm began to wail. inside four minutes, gaunt's strike team had entered the spike via the gun-ports, all seventy-eight of them. three had died in the initial engagement. gaunt checked on mkoll. his wound was superficial and he was already back on his feet. the strike force spread out to cover all the exitways on the gloomy gundeck. he led the way to a main blast door that gave access to the spike's inner cavities. it was locked fast. gaunt drew the powersword of heironymo sondar, activated it, and sliced the incandescent blade through the hatch. a further three sweeps and a kick left the hatchway open, the cut section of metal clanging as it fell on the deck outside. the spike's main weapon deck was linked to the primary command sections by a long, sloping accessway wide enough for a leman russ to drive along it. it was painted matt red, the colour of meat, and thick bulkhead frames stood at every twenty metres. the floor was a metal grille and in the underfloor cavity, pipes, tubing and feeder cables could be seen. off to either side, just on the other side of the blast door, stood service elevators with metal cage frames, set in circular loading docks. the elevators were heavy-duty freight lifts designed to haul shells from the munition stockpiles deep in the belly of the spike up to the artillery blisters on the upper slopes.  the metal walls of the accessway were covered with intricate emblems, the curious, nauseating runes of chaos. gaunt realised they had been fashioned from bone that had been inlaid into the metal and then polished flat with the wall so they glowed and shone like pearl. human bone, he guessed. the heritor would demand such details. a team of zoican heavy troopers in segmented ochre body armour greeted them in the accessway as they entered, firing up the sloping tunnel from cover at the far end. one of the scratches, a man whose name gaunt would never know, was sliced apart by the initial shots. his blood sprayed the bone icons on the wall, and the symbols began to squirm and shift. larkin saw this and fell back in horror, his guts churning. the eldritch symbols were alive, excited by blood. he knew he was about to vomit with fear. banda asked sourly as she pushed past him, firing down at the enemy position. the imperials were hugging the walls and using the bulkheads for cover, edging down the accessway as far as the enemy fire would allow. larkin gulped. he was incredulous. no smirking girl from the hab looms would show him up. larkin grinned and made another kill-shot. either he was beginning to like this woman, or he'd kill her himself. another of the scratches fell, ripped open by the mauling heavy weapons the enemy had trained on them. they were caught too tightly between the hall and the entry point gaunt had cut open. his men fanned round into the side loading docks, but they were packed in. gaunt yelled. the flamer-trooper was still trying to pull his bulky tanks through the narrow opening gaunt's powersword had sliced. las-rounds peppered the metal around him. a ghost nearby, lonner, collapsed with the back of his neck blown out. dremmond was clear. gaunt and kolea physically dragged the big ghost to the front of the line and dremmond braced his scorched flame-gun, ensuring the feed-pipe wasn't twisted and the igniter was sparking. he squeezed the trigger grip and billows of white-hot flame sheeted down the tunnel, incinerating the zoican heavies. the scourging flame bubbled the paint off the walls and the twitching bone-runes began to shriek. he washed the hall with another gout to be sure, and then rawne, haller and bragg led off to secure the hall. bragg reached the position the enemy had been holding and he stepped over the black, fused corpses. there was another accessway to his left and he sprayed bursts of autogun fire through the door mouth. haller moved to the right and went over hard as a half-burned zoican soldier threw himself at the scratch officer. the blackened thing, its ceramite armour part-melted into its flesh by dremmond's flames, tore at him in a frenzy. haller screamed out, frantic. rawne grabbed the zoican and threw it off haller. it bounced off a wall and, before it could rise, rawne had shot it four times with his lasgun. haller paused, as if slapped in the face. he hadn't much liked the look of the tanith major when they had all first assembled. it seemed true. rawne snorted to bragg. already there were noises from the side tunnels and fresh zoican forces were firing on them. the main strike force had moved up by then. gilbear swung a party of blue-bloods to the right and cremated a side-tunnel with grenades from their under-barrel launchers. mkvenner hurried right with four tanith and a number of scratches, moving to secure their advance from enemy prosecution. a las-round hit him in the arm and spun him to the deck. domor, right behind him, knelt over the injured scout and sprayed las-fire down at the hidden shooter, calling for a medic. beside him, vinya, one of the loom-girls, rebounded off the wall as a brace of las-shots caught her in the belly. several troopers pushed past domor to hold the side-tunnel, flaying las-fire down into the dark. gherran joined domor, running low, holding a las pistol in one hand, the other hand curled around the narthecium kit to stop it jolting. the medic dropped to his knees beside the scout. the las-shot had exploded mkvenner's left elbow and disintegrated his biceps. he was curled up, crying with pain, but he forced his voice to work. he scrambled over to the sprawled scratch soldier. she was twisted like a broken puppet, her chin forced into her chest where she lay with the back of her head against the wall. blood oozed out of her in a wide pool. gherran spat. vinya � gherran cried, recoiling in horror. gherran wiped his mouth. gherran gathered his kit-pack and moved over to mkvenner. kolea picked up his lasgun and strode past, rejoining the fight.  cocoer, neskon and flinn had made it to the corner of the right hand side access, and they drove the gathering zoicans backwards. gaunt, with genx and maroy, crawled up behind them. the air was flickering with las crossfire. neskon cried as his gun jammed. he shook it. then humour me. i've learned to go with mkoll's instincts. if i'm wrong, i'll stand you a case of wine. yelled rawne, hastening from the bundle of tube charges he had glued to the shield hatch. the channelled blast tore the doors inwards like paper. whatever else you could say about him, rawne knew explosives. mouthed nessa to herself, close on their heels. guild githran agricultural had fallen. corbec drove his tanith back towards the base of the main spine with all hell following. milo and baffels guided their survivor company out of the ruins, chased by zoican tank groups. bray's mixed units wilted in retreat as divisions of zoican stormtroopers drove up into the inner habs. the shield pylon shuddered as it took shell after shell. at croe gate, grizmund's valiant counteraction finally reached a stop. flat crabs and spider death machines lumbered in at them, in strengths even the crusade's finest tank regiment could not withstand. on the dock causeway, varl and rodyin began to pull their infantry back, facing an ochre host ten thousand strong. along the edge of the commercia, where one of the war's bloodiest battles had been waged, bulwar ordered his northcol and scratch companies to retreat. overhead, the shield flickered and waned. it would not last much longer. in the middle of a horrendous brawl in a side trench, soric hammered his axe-rake into the foe. he was one of the last to heed bulwar's retreat order. corday's volpone unit was pincered by zoican detachments. the blue-bloods were slaughtered by crossfire in the rubble wastes that had once been the inner-sector habs. corday died with his men. in a lost pocket in the wastelands, caffran held tona criid tight, yoncy and dalin curled between them. the sky was on fire and shells fell all around. it was just a matter of time, caffran knew. but until then, he would hold her and the children as tight as he could. in the baptistry, ban daur set aside his headset and sat back in his seat. the workers and staff servitors were still milling around, trying to maintain some semblance of control. it was over. daur got up and crossed to otte at the font. windows blew in down the hall and the main spine shuddered as shells struck it. intendant banefail joined them. otte looked at him reprovingly, but banefail seemed to agree. immaculus nodded. he led his brethren into the celebratory and the soft dirge, a haunting melody, began to lift above the baptistry and the high stations of vervunhive. in the abandoned hall of her house, high in the spine, merity chass heard the low plainsong welling through the walls. she had put on a long, formal gown and her father's ducal chain and signet ring, which daur had brought to her. she had spent an hour putting the house chass ledgers in order and encrypting all the family documents onto storage crystals. at the sound of the mass, she frowned. �major rawne, of his commander its sounds amplified by the thick, metal walls around, carnage exploded into the spike's command level. savage fighting boiled through the dark, mesh-floored chambers. the strikeforce were engaging crew now as well as troops. the crew members wore loose flak-tunics and work-fatigues, and their heads were generally exposed. gaunt's troopers could see for themselves the horror that had disturbed larkin so at veyveyr gate.  it wasn't the implants fused and sutured into their eyes, ears and scalps, linking their senses and brain patterns to the insidious chatter. it was the fact that they were men and women of all ages: hab workers, parents, guilders, older children, the elderly. the entirety of zoica's population had mobilised for war, just as gaunt had assessed. the bald proof was overwhelmingly tragic. with blank expressions, somehow even more lifeless than sondar's servitor puppets, the people of ferrozoica threw themselves at the attackers. gaunt hacked through a pair of zoican troopers with his powersword, fighting to cut a route down onto the main bridge area. through the seething press, the smoke and the flashes of las-fire, he could make out a wide, open platform of polished chrome, surrounded by black towers of control instrumentation. in the centre of the platform, the glowing, pinkish ball of a coherent light field, ten metres in diameter, coalesced up from an emitter ring in the floor. he fought his way to it, channelling his deepest reserves of aggression and determination. suddenly, he was on the platform itself, virtually alone, lit by the pink radiance. his last frenzied efforts to break through had been almost too successful. he'd effectively separated himself from the rest of his party, still locked into the mayhem in the adjacent bridge areas. gaunt was breathing hard and shaking. he'd lost his cap somewhere, his jacket was torn and he was splattered with blood. an almost painful adrenaline high fizzled through him like electricity glowing through fuse-wire. he had never been pushed to such an extremity of raw fury before in his life. his mind was locked out in a paroxysm of battle-rage. everything had become distant and incomprehensible. for a moment, he couldn't remember what he was supposed to be doing. something flickered behind him and he wheeled, his blade flashing as it made contact. a tall, black figure lurched backwards. it was thin but powerful and much taller than him, dressed in form-fitting, glossy-black armour and a hooded cape of chainmail. the visage under the hood-lip was feral and non-human, like the snarling skull of a great wolf-hound with the skin scraped off. it clutched a sabre-bladed powersword in its metal-gloved hands. gaunt had seen its like before, on balhaut. he'd glimpsed its kind distantly on the fields of war, during the final stage of the battle, and then seen several corpses closer to after the victory. it was one of the dark-watch, the elite retinue of chaos champions who had been gifted to the warlord, asphodel, as his personal bodyguard. the thing flickered again, employing its monstrous, innate control of the warp to shift its location around him. gaunt yelled and blocked the incoming blade of the repositioned horror. the cold blue energies of heironymo's powersword clashed against the sparking, blood-red fires of the darkwatcher's weapon. it flicker-shifted again, just a few paces to the left, and sliced its sword around at him. gaunt evaded, stumbling in his haste, rolling and then springing up in time to block the downward swing of the chaos-tainted blade. but this was not the same weapon. this was longer, straighter, incandescent with smoking green fire. a second darkwatcher, shifting in to assist the first. without looking, gaunt threw himself sideways, knowing the original fury was now behind him. red energy sliced a gouge in the gleaming chrome deck. he backed as they came at him together, both flickering in and out of reality. one was suddenly to his left, but gaunt threw all his force behind a blocking strike that bounced the blade away. the other sliced in at him and caught gaunt's right shoulder. there was no pain. a cold, nauseating numbness ached into his wounded limb. gaunt hurled himself forward in a tuck roll, avoiding two more slashes. he knew he had never been this outmatched before, not even face to face with howling world eater chaos marines in the underworld of fortis binary or surrounded by the iron men in the crypts of menazoid epsilon. he should be dead already. but something kept him alive. partly his elevated battle-edge, partly his determination, but also , he was sure, heironymo's sword. it seemed to smell the shifting creatures and forewarn him � by a tingle � of their impossible movements. their shifting was localised, as if they were moving in and out of corporeal reality. every time they became solid to strike, the sword twitched in his grip, moving him to block. he ducked a scything arc of green energy and stabbed upwards, shearing one darkwatcher's head off in a flurry of blue sparks. lambent, frosty smoke jetted out of its tall form as it collapsed in upon itself, flickering and fading. a inhuman scream rang around the bridge. the other lunged at him, flickering into being right in his face, and though the powersword pulled at him, he wasn't quick enough to avoid the deep gouge the red blade sliced in his left thigh. gaunt fell. a spray of autocannon split the air above him. bragg had made it to the edge of the platform and was blasting at the darkwatcher on full auto. the thing shuddered under the impacts, flickering in and out of real-space, its chain cloak whipping as it turned to face the new attack. kolea and mkoll were there too, heaving up onto the edge of the chrome level, opening fire at the beast. a second later, neskon, haller, flinn, banda and a volpone called tonsk had also reached the edge of the platform. sustained fire from all of them drove the raging chaos-thing backwards � and targeted the other two that had manifested in the last few moments. bragg's unrelenting fire-cone gradually disintegrated the red-bladed darkwatcher, which advanced on him, despite the colossal wash of bullets, before finally exploding a few flicker-steps from him. one of the others, wielding a pike-axe which smoked with orange lightning, chopped tonsk in two and severed neskon's left leg at the knee with one stroke. haller snatched up the blueblood's fallen hellgun, pumped the underbarrel launcher and blew the thing's head off with a rocket-grenade. the others, supported by more of the strike force just making it to the platform, caught the remaining darkwatcher in a crossfire. the thing shrieked and flickered, twisting in the las-hail. behind them, the remaining elements of gaunt's brigade fought a desperate rearguard at the zoicans pouring into the command area from all around. gaunt clawed at one of the instrumentation towers at the edge of the platform and pulled himself to his feet. hololithic screens projecting from the domed roof above showed fuzzy, amber-tinted views of the onslaught outside. the spike, with its supporting armoured legions, had exploded in through the curtain wall just east of sondar gate, and the war machine's vast batteries, presumably recrewed after gaunt's entry assault, targeted and demolished the shield pylon in a blaze of fire. sections of the huge structure crashed down across the commercia, like a titanic tree being felled, wreathed in great washes of flame instead of foliage. rather than being deactivated as before, the shield collapsed, its massive energies unsecured and arcing out. the energy flare, designed to protect the city of vervunhive, ripped the top ten levels off the main spine, and all the anchor stations around the city perimeter exploded.  the powersword loose in his hand , gaunt searched the instrumentation around him for some system he could recognise. it had been built by the tech-wrights of ferrozoica, so its essential patterns were imperial, but the markings and format were wretched and alien. gaunt staggered across to the next tower and resumed his search. he found what appeared to be a vox-terminal and a pict-link displayer. but nothing else he could understand. behind him, the last darkwatcher exploded, taking trooper flinn with it. the third tower. halfway down, what could only be a data-slate reader with a universal hub: standard imperial fitting. gaunt felt himself sag, his leg wound pulling at him. yelled kolea, at his side, supporting him. gaunt shook the big miner off. if this was the final act, it would be his. he pulled the ticking, chuckling amulet from his pocket and fitted its link ports to the reader's hub. it engaged, purred and turned twice like a kodoc beetle burying its abdomen in the sand. the lighting and instrument power in the command section shorted on and off two, three, four times. a mechanical wailing of tortured, over-raced turbines welled up from the vast machine pits below them. the chatter cut short. then the lights went out altogether. sudden, total darkness; sudden quiet. in the stillness, the groans of the dying and wounded; the bright, brief crackle and fizz of torn cables. a flash of las-fire. gaunt's eyes grew accustomed to the gloom. the heart of the spike was dead. smoke wafted, full of the rich, animal smells of war. men stirred, blinking. the force field in the centre of the platform had vanished. a huge form, dark like a shadow, crouched where the field had been. it rose, unfurled, grew larger. in the halflight, gaunt saw the richly embroidered silk of a vast cape spilling away from the figure as it stood. he saw an immense, metal-gloved hand reach out and beckon to him. he saw the shivering flame-light throw into relief a long, smooth armour-cowl split by narrow eye-slits. the cowl fanned up and out into massive, hooked steeples of polished horn. heritor asphodel, chaos warlord, daemon-thing, fuelled by his dark gods in the warp, standing fully six metres tall, lunged at the human worms who strove to defeat him. he made no sound. darkness, which he seemed to wear and pull around him like a great cloak, sucked through the air as it moved with him. kolea buried his axe-rake in the heritor's flank. a second later, he was flying sideways across the platform, most of his ribs shattered. firing and making two hits, mkoll was knocked sideways, his shoulder broken. domor's lasgun exploded in his hands, blowing him up, back and off the platform. gherran was lacerated by an ebbing fold of darkness, sharp as a billion blades. his blood made a mist that drenched gaunt. genx was pulverised by the concussive force of the daemon's fist as he tried to reload his weapon and fire. gaunt met asphodel head on. he slammed the blazing blue spike of the powersword into and through the monstrosity's chest. at the same moment, the massive bolt pistol clenched in the heritor's left hand shot gaunt through the heart. � warmaster macaroth, at verghast they came like ghosts at dusk. phantom forms, impossibly large, underlit by the dying sun as they settled down through the smoke-filthy upper atmosphere of verghast. warships, bulk troop transports, the might of the sabbat worlds crusade, the pride of the segmentum pacificus navy. it was the fiftieth day. learning via the astropathicus that vervunhive faced not an inconsequential rival hive but a hunted chaos commander, macaroth had made best speed for verghast, arriving after twenty-seven days of urgent transit through the warp. the hazy sky was full of metal and looked like it should fall. the awesome power of the imperium was there for every verghastite to see: ten thousand ships, some the size of cities, some bloated like ornate oceanic turtles, some slender and serrated like airborne cathedrals. macaroth unleashed his might on the planet below: six million guardsmen, half a million tanks, squads drawn from three chapters of the adeptus astartes, two titan legions. troop dropships, bulk machine-lifters and shuttles dropped in a swarm on the hass valley. for a while, the sky did fall. mass destruction followed, lasting for five days, thought it was brutally one-sided. heironymo's amulet had done its work and cut the insidious chatter for all time. by the time the warmaster's immense forces arrived, the zoicans were already in total rout. aimless and lost, they broke off the final assault. many committed suicide or wandered blindly into the defenders' fields of fire to be massacred. millions of others woke as if from a dream and stumbled, without purpose or motive, back into the grasslands. under grizmund's command, the battered imperial forces that had held vervunhive for over a month reformed to drive the pitiful, bewildered invaders out. narmenian and northcol tank brigades chased down and annihilated zoican motorised units threading back across the grasslands towards their own hive. guard infantry, co-ordinated by colonel corbec, colonel bulwar and major otte, utilising every troop-carrying machine they could raise, hunted out and slaughtered the fleeing troop elements in vast numbers. there was no question of mercy. ferrozoica's taint had to be expunged. by the time macaroth's armada made orbit, the zoicans had been driven back six hundred kilometres into the plains, leaving vehicles and equipment scattered and abandoned in their wake. in the crippled hive itself, scratch companies slowly weeded out the last, feral pockets of zoican resistance. the warmaster followed up with unstinting vigour. he politely but determinedly requested the assistance of the iron snakes space marines to overtake and neutralise the fleeing enemy. his armoured brigades poured down the main highways and decimated everything that lived. skeletal titans, shrieking like wraiths, stalked the grassland horizons, incinerating the retreating foe. on the fifty-fourth day, crusade warships torched ferrozoica hive from low orbit. the blinding flame-flare filled the southern horizon. but by then, the fight was out of the zoicans and had been since the thirty-seventh day. without the hypnotic chatter to unify their cause and drive them on, they had crumbled. imperial fist space marines ceremonially destroyed the spike and incinerated the heritor's corpse. the final battle was one of humanitarian support. intendant banefail, along with the hive elders and noble houses, laboured to accommodate the millions of wounded and homeless. by day sixty, the true scale of the human cost was undeniable. vervunhive was a necropolis: a city of the dead. meeting with the surviving nobility, macaroth signed the dissolution warrant that formally acknowledged vervunhive's extinction. the hive was dead.  all population elements were to be absorbed by the northern collectives or shipped to ghasthive and the isthmus steeples. two new hives were to be founded, one ruled by a clique of noble houses under house anko, the other a collective governed by houses chass and rodyin. names would come later. it would be generations until these municipal structures would begin to establish themselves, and it would be decades before the bulk of the dispossessed population could be given new, permanent homes. lord anko, siting his new hive's foundations higher up the hass waters from dead vervunhive, planned to exploit the prometheum reserves once controlled by vannick. lady chass, the first woman to govern a collective on vervunhive, set her foundation in the grasslands far to the south and turned to mining and servitor engineering. their future rivalry and confrontation would be long and complex, but is not pertinent to this history. at the time, an air of disillusion fell hard on the survivors of vervunhive. many felt they had given everything in defence of the city only to see the city abandoned anyway. when this mood was made known to the war-master, he spoke publicly about his decision and made law an act of consolation. the warmaster's staff faced a thousand duties as they tidied up the mess of the vervunhive war. one of those was the prosecution of all those who had acted in a manner disloyal to the emperor during that period of great hardship. the reports of the tanith sergeant varl, as logged by his commander, gaunt, were sorted and processed by the administratum during the latter stages of the purge. on day fifty-nine, prosecuting war-crime charges, vervun primary troops stormed the halls of guild worlin. amchanduste worlin was not to be found. ibram gaunt heaved himself upright on his cot. the pain of his shoulder and thigh wounds had long since faded, but the burning ache in his chest still plagued him. he coughed blood, for the third time since corbec had arrived. under the terms of the act of consolation, any disillusioned vervunhiver anxious to leave verghast to find a new life was offered the possibility of training for a place in the imperial guard. upwards of forty thousand elected to do so. some made their choice of unit a condition of their acceptance. motor convoys carried them north with the regular army to board bulk carriers that had put in at kannak port. sergeant agun soric oversaw the embarkation of his brave irregulars. all of them were yet to be issued with their tanith fatigues and camo-capes. soric moved past the ship's payload doors and greeted sergeant kolea, who had also joined up, along with most of his scratch company. kolea was walking on crutches, his torso encased in mediplas bindings. under his breath, he uttered a last goodbye to his lost wife and beloved children. half a kilometre away, bragg supervised the loading of other ghosts. many, like domor and mkoll, were walking wounded. along with the soldiers came the inevitable wave of camp followers, lugging their possessions: clerks, cooks, armourers, mechanics, women. bragg caught sight of caffran leading a girl and two children up the ramp. one was just a babe in arms. he noticed that the girl, along with her piercings and surly look, wore the temporary badge of a guard recruit. another female trooper. bad enough kolea's fighting women had been given a place. larkin would have a seizure. jumping down from his transit truck, ban daur took a last, wistful look at the land around him. he felt like a lost soul given one last chance to haunt the place that had raised him. that was appropriate. he wasn't captain ban daur of vervun primary anymore. he was a ghost. she held out the dog tags that had been in the pocket of her apron since veyveyr gate. curth let go of dorden and turned round to the guilder. both of you? dorden and curth? yes? what did you want to tell us? what did you see? the first shot punched through dorden's right hand, the second through his left thigh. the third hit curth in the shoulder and threw her across the room. a bolt round blew worlin's head off in matted chunks. gaunt, gun raised, limped into the swab-room, supported by the bewildered corbec. gaunt nodded. he looked back across the hass at the dead ruins of vervunhive. they continued to burn in the low, morning light. he took the shattered petals of the metal flower dorden had cut out of his flesh and cast them out across the water.    a warhammer 40,000 novel honour guard gaunt's ghosts - 04 it is the 41st millennium. for more than a hundred centuries the emperor has sat immobile on the golden throne of earth. he is the master of mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. he is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the dark age of technology. he is the carrion lord of the imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die. yet even in his deathless state, the emperor continues his eternal vigilance. mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the emperor's will. vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. greatest amongst his soldiers are the adeptus astartes, the space marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. their comrades in arms are legion: the imperial guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant inquisition and the tech-priests of the adeptus mechanicus to name only a few. but for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse. to be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. it is to live in the cruellest and most bloody regime imaginable. these are the tales of those times. forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. there is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods. the monumental imperial crusade to liberate the sabbat worlds cluster from the grip of chaos had been raging for over a decade and a half when warmaster macaroth began his daring assaults on the strategically vital cabal system. this phase of reconquest lasted almost two whole years, and featured a bravura, multi-point invasion scheme devised by macaroth himself. simultaneous imperial assaults were launched against nineteen key planets, including three of the notorious fortress-worlds, shaking the dug-in resolve of the numerically superior but less well-orchestrated enemy. from his war room logs, we know that macaroth fully appreciated the scale of his gamble. if successful, this phase of assault would virtually guarantee an overall imperial victory for the campaign. if it failed, his whole crusade force, an armed host over a billion strong, might well be entirely overrun. for two bloody, bitter years, the fate of the sabbat worlds crusade hung in the balance. serious analysis of this period inevitably focuses on the large-scale fortress-world theatres, most particularly on the eighteen month war to take the massive fortress-world morlond. but several of the subsidiary crusade assaults conducted during this phase are deserving of close study, especially the liberation of the shrineworld hagia and the remarkable events that afterwards unfolded there � �from a history of the later imperial crusades �catechism of hagia, bk i, chp 3, vrs xxxii they'd strung the king up with razor wire in a city square north of the river. it was called the square of sublime tranquillity, an eight-hectare court of sun-baked, pink basalt surrounded by the elegant, mosaic walls of the universitariate doctrinus. little in the way of sublime tranquillity had happened there in the last ten days. the pater's pilgrims had seen to that. ibram gaunt made a sharp, bat-like shadow on the flagstones as he ran to new cover, his storm coat flying out behind him. the sun was at its highest and a stark glare scorched the hard ground. gaunt knew the light must be burning his skin too, but he felt nothing except the cool, blustering wind that filled the wide square. he dropped into shelter behind an overturned, burnt-out chimera troop carrier, and dumped the empty clip from his bolt pistol with a flick-click of his gloved thumb. he could hear a popping sound from far away, and raw metal dents appeared in the blackened armour of the dead chimera's hull. distant shots, their sound stolen by the wind. far behind, across the cooking pink stones of the open square, he could see black-uniformed imperial guardsmen edging out to follow him. his men. troopers of the tanith first-and-only. gaunt noted their dispersal and glanced back at the king. the high king indeed, as he had been. what was his name again? rotten, swollen, humiliated, the noble corpse swung from a gibbet made of tie-beams and rusting truck-axles and couldn't answer. most of his immediate court and family were dangling next to him. more popping. a hard, sharp dent appeared in the resilient metal next to gaunt's head. crumbs of paint flecked off with the impact. mkoll ducked into cover beside him, lasrifle braced. hah! i trained you too fething well, colonel-commissar, that's all it is. four shooters. in the north-west corner. nine at least. larkin, derin and caffran laughed. they were all tanith, original ghosts, veterans. lillo and vamberfeld watched the apparently disrespectful exchange with alarm. they were vervunhivers, newcomers to the ghosts regiment. the new vervunhive recruits wore the same matt-black fatigues and body armour as the tanith, but their colouring and demeanour stood them apart. as did their newly stamped, metal-stocked lasguns and the special silver axe-rake studs they wore on their collars. lillo nodded back, but resented the tanith's cocky attitude. he was marco lillo, career soldier, twenty-one years in the vervun primary, and here was a kid, no more than twenty years old all told, telling him what to do. lillo shuffled round, aiming his long lasgun. distractedly, he rubbed at a ridge of an old scar across his right palm. lillo thought he had a shot and fired a sustained burst at the far side of the square. lattice windows along the side of the universitariat exploded inwards, but the hard breeze muffled the noise of the impacts. he knows my name! he knows my name! lillo was almost beside himself with the fact. he stared at gaunt, basking in every moment of the brief acknowledgement. ibram gaunt was like a god to him. he had led vervunhive to victory out of the surest defeat ten months past. he carried the sword to prove it. lillo regarded the colonel-commissar now: the tall, powerful build, the close-cropped blond hair half hidden by the commissar's cap, the lean cut of his intense face that so matched his name. gaunt was dressed in the black uniform of his breed, overtopped by a long, leather storm coat and the trademark tanith camo-cape. maybe not a god, because he's flesh and blood , lillo thought� but a hero, none the less. larkin was firing. hard, scratchy rasps issued from his gun. the rate of fire spitting over their ducked heads reduced. mkoll caught his sleeve and nodded back at the buildings behind them. vamberfeld saw a big man� a very big man� rise from cover and fire a missile launcher. the snaking missile, trailing smoke, struck a coronet on the west of the square. derin, mkoll and larkin chorused with a laugh. another missile soared over them, and blew the far corner of the square apart. stone debris scattered across the open plaza. gaunt was up and running now, as were mkoll, caffran and derin. larkin continued to fire his expert shots from cover. vamberfeld and lillo leapt up after the tanith. lillo saw derin buckle and fall as las-fire cut through him. he paused and tried to help. the tanith trooper's chest was a bloody mess and he was convulsing so hard it was impossible for lillo to get a good grip on him. mkoll appeared beside the struggling lillo and together they dragged derin into cover behind the makeshift gibbet as more las-fire peppered the flagstones. gaunt, caffran and vamberfeld made it to the far corner of the square. gaunt disappeared in through the jagged hole that bragg's missile had made, his power sword raised and humming. it was the ceremonial weapon of heironymo sondar, once-lord of vervunhive, and gaunt now carried it as a mark of honour for his courageous defence of that hive. the keening, electric-blue blade flashed as it struck at shapes inside the hole. caffran ducked in after him, blasting from the hip. few of the ghosts were better than him in storm clearance. he was fast and ruthless. he blocked gaunt's back, gun flaring. niceg vamberfeld had been a commercia cleric on verghast before the art of consolation. he'd trained hard, and well, but this was all new to him. he followed the pair inside, plunging into a suddenly gloomy world of shadows, shadow-shapes and blazing energy weapons. he shot something point blank as he came through the crumpled stone opening. something else reared up at him, cackling, and he lanced it with his bayonet. he couldn't see the commissar-colonel or the young tanith trooper anymore. he couldn't see a gakking thing, in fact. he started to panic. something else shot at him from close range and a las-round spat past his ear. he fired again, blinded by the close shot, and heard a dead weight fall. something grabbed him from behind. there was an impact, and a spray of dust and blood. vamberfeld fell over clumsily, a corpse on top of him. face down in the hot dirt, vamberfeld found his vision returning. he was suffused in blue light. vamberfeld was dumbstruck. and also covered in blood. the name was meant to mock it too; by choosing a name in the local tongue, the enemy were defiling the very sanctity of the place. for six thousand years, this had been the shrineworld of saint sabbat, one of the most beloved of imperial saints, after whom this entire star cluster � and this imperial crusade � were named. by taking hagia and proclaiming themselves pilgrims, the foe were committing the ultimate desecration. what unholy rites they had conducted here in hagia's holy places did not bear thinking about. vamberfeld had learned all about pater sin and his chaos filth from the regimental briefings on the troop ship. seeing it was something else. he glanced at the corpse nearest him: a large, gnarled man swathed in green silk wraps. where the wraps parted or were torn away, vamberfeld could see a wealth of tattoos: images of saint sabbat in grotesque congress with lascivious daemons, images of hell, runes of chaos overstamping and polluting blessed symbols. he felt light-headed. despite the months of training he had endured after joining the ghosts, he was still out of shape: a desk-bound cleric playing at being soldier. his panic deepened. caffran was suddenly firing again, splintering the dark with his muzzle-flashes. vamberfeld couldn't see gaunt anymore. he threw himself flat on his belly and propped his gun as colonel corbec had taught him during fundamental and preparatory. his shots rattled up the colonnade past caffran, supporting the young tanith's salvoes.  ahead, a flock of figures in shimmering green flickered down the cloister, firing lasguns and automatic hard-slug weapons at them. vamberfeld could hear chanting too. chanting wasn't the right word, he realised. as they approached, the figures were murmuring, muttering long and complex phrases that overlapped and intertwined. he felt the sweat on his back go cold. he fired again. these troops were infardi, the elite of pater sin. emperor save him, he was in it up to his neck! gaunt dropped to his knee next to him, aiming and firing his bolt pistol in a two-handed brace the trio of imperial guns pummelled the infardi advance in the narrow space. there was a flash and a dull roar, and then light streamed in ahead of them, cutting into the side of the infardi charge. blowing another breach in the cloister, more ghosts poured in, slaughtering the advancing foe. gaunt rose. the half-seen fighting ahead was sporadic now. he keyed his microbead intercom. trooper brin milo, the youngest ghost, came running over at his commander's cry. the only civilian saved from tanith, saved by gaunt personally, milo had served as gaunt's adjutant until he had been old enough to join the ranks. all the ghosts respected his close association with the colonel-commissar. though an ordinary trooper, milo was held in special regard. milo nodded and saluted. a drizzle of las-blasts rocked the old sandstone water-tub, scattering chips of stone. corbec had his head buried against the base of the water-tub. he could smell damp stone. he saw, in sharp focus, tiny spiders clinging to filmy cones of web in the tub's bas-relief carvings, inches from his eyes. he felt the warm stone shudder against his cheek as las-rounds hit the other side. this is two! he sneaked a look around the edge of the tub and threw himself back. a single lasround whipped past, exploding against the wall behind him. it would have taken his head off if he hadn't moved. corbec rolled back onto his arse, his back against the tub, and checked his lasrifle. the curved magazine of the wooden-stocked weapon was two-thirds dry, so he pulled it out and snapped in a fresh one. the right-hand thigh pocket of his body armour was heavy with half-used dips. he always changed up to full-load when there was a chance. the half-spent were there at hand for dug-in resistance.  he'd known more than one trooper who'd died when his cell had drained out in the middle of a firelight, when there was no time to reload. there was a burst of firing ahead of him. corbec spun, and noted the change in tone. the dull snap of the infardi weapons was intermingled with the higher, piercing reports of imperial guns. he lifted his head above the edge of the tub. when he didn't get it shot off, he rolled up onto his feet and ran down the narrow alleyway. there was fighting ahead. he leapt over the body of an infardi sprawled in a doorway. the curving street was narrow and the dwellings on either side were tall. he hurried between hard shadow and patches of sunlight. he came up behind three ghosts, firing from cover across a market yard. no one, not even the most war-weary and cynical tanith, had anything but respect for the man and his selfless determination. the verghastites practically worshipped him. he was a driven, quiet giant, almost the size of corbec himself. the colonel slid into cover beside him. corbec liked the man immensely, but he had to admit the ex-miner had no sense of humour. in the months since the new recruits had joined the ghosts, corbec hadn't managed to engage kolea at all in small talk or personal chat, and he was pretty sure none of the others had managed it either. but then the battle for vervunhive had taken his wife and children, so corbec imagined kolea didn't have much to laugh or chat about anymore. kolea pointed out over the crates of rotting produce they were using as cover. he swung inside. in the old shop, troopers rilke, yael and leyr were dug in, firing through the lowered window shutters. they muttered various comments about the wanton proclivities of his mother and several other of his female relatives. he began stamping on the pottery-covered floor. he was a youngster, no more than twenty-two, with a youngster's insubordinate cheek. the trio groaned. have i got you dead yet? kolea scrambled in through the shell hole a few seconds later. he found corbec shining his lamp-pack into the open cellar hatch. leyr and yael did so, as did corbec himself. the cloaks went onto the floor, as did other loose items.  all four copies of the imperial infantryman's uplifting primer hit the cloaks at the same time. sergeant kolea tamped a spike into the tiled floor and ran the end of his climbing rope through the eye. he dropped the snake of cable down into the hole. he asked. corbec would have preferred to let kolea lead, but this was his call and he wanted them to know he trusted it. he grabbed the rope, slung his lasrifle over his shoulder, and clambered down into the hole. kolea followed, then leyr. yael brought up the rear. the cellar shaft was eight metres deep. almost immediately, corbec was struggling and sweating. even though he had ditched a lot of kit, the sheer bulk of his webbing and body armour was confining him and screwing with his centre of balance. he landed on a floor in the darkness and switched on his lamp-pack. the air was thick and foetid. he was in a cellar space four metres wide, dripping with ancient fluid and rot. spat leyr as he made the ground. there was an arched conduit snaking off towards the underyard. it was less than a metre high and only half a metre wide. with kit and weapons, even stripped down, they had to hunch and edge in sideways, single file. the liquid ooze on the floor sucked up around their boot-tops. corbec attached his lamp-pack to the bayonet fitting under his lasgun's muzzle. it was the closest corbec had ever heard to a joke from the scratch sergeant. neither leyr and yael topped out over two metres. corbec smiled. � saint sabbat, proverbs brin milo, his lasgun slung muzzle-down over his shoulder, made his way against the press of traffic approaching the square from the south. detachments of tanith and light mechanised support from the eighth pardus armoured were pouring into the universitariat district from the fighting zones to the south-west moving in to support the commissar's push. milo ducked into doorways as troop carriers and hydra batteries grumbled past and slid sideways to pass platoons marching four abreast. friends and comrades called greetings to him as they moved by, a few breaking step to quiz him on the front ahead. most of them were caked in pink dust and sweating, but morale was generally high. fighting had been intense during the last fortnight but the imperial forces had made great gains. varl nodded, but questions from some of his men were drowned by an air horn. yelled a pardus officer, rising up in the open cab of his salamander command vehicle. a line of flamer tanks and tubby siege gun platforms was bottling up behind him. varl responded, waving his men back against the street wall. the pardus machines rumbled past. the armour officer called out, standing in the rear of his bucking machine and throwing a mock salute as he went by. varl returned, raising a single digit in response to the salute that all the tanith in his squad immediately mimicked. brin milo smiled. the pardus were a good lot, and such horseplay typified the good humour with which they and the tanith co-operated in this advance. behind the light armour came trojans and other tractor units hauling heavy munitions and stowed field artillery, then tanith pushing handcarts liberated from the weavers' barns. the carts were laden with ammunition boxes and tanks of promethium for the flamers. varl's men were called over to help lift a cart out of a drain gutter and milo moved on. hurrying against the flow of men and munitions, the young trooper reached the arch of the great red-stone bridge over the river.  shell holes decorated its ancient surface, and sappers from the pardus regiment were hanging over the sides on ropes, shoring up its structure and sweeping for explosives. in this part of the doctrinopolis, the river surged through a deep, man-made channel, its sides formed by the basalt river walls and the sides of the buildings. the smooth water was a deep green, deeper than the shade of the infardi robes. a sacred river, milo had been told. milo took directions from the tanith corporal directing traffic at the junction, and left the main thoroughfare by a flight of steps that brought him down onto a riverwall path leading under the bridge itself. the water lapped at the stone three metres below and reflected ripples of white off the dark underside of the bridge. he made his way to an archway overlooking the water further along the wall. it was the river entrance to one of the lesser shrines and tired, hungry-looking locals loitered around the entrance. the shrine had been turned into a makeshift hospital early in the assault by local physicians and priests, and now, on gaunt's orders, imperial medical personnel had moved in to take charge. stretcher parties were arriving all the time, mostly with civilian injured, and the long, arched shrine was filling up. lesp looked harried. will i do? milo and the hagian girl went out of the hospital into the hard sunlight of the river wall. she put her hands together and made brief nods of respect to the river and the sky before turning to him. milo shook his head. she looked at him quizzically. a line of trojans rattled by over the bridge above them. bottom line was, rawne had never really trusted women much. and he'd certainly never trusted men who put too much trust in women. caffran, for example. one of the youngest ghosts: compact, strong, a fine soldier. on verghast, he'd gotten involved with a local girl and they'd been inseparable ever since. a couple, would you believe? and rawne knew for a fact the girl had a pair of young children who were cared for amongst the other non-combatants and campfollowers in the regimental escort ships. her name was tona criid. she was eighteen, lean and hard, with spiky bleached hair and gang tattoos that spoke of a rough life even before the vervunhive war.  rawne watched her as she walked with caffran down the shattered universitariat hallway, covering each other, checking doors and alcoves. she moved with easy grace. she knew what she was doing. the black ghost uniform fitted her well. she was� good-looking. rawne turned away and scratched behind his ear. these women were going to be the death of someone. the clearance squad prowled forward, picking their way down empty halls over the glass of broken windows and the kindling of shattered furniture. rawne found himself moving level with the other female in his squad. her name was banda, an ex-loom worker from vervunhive who'd fought in the famous guerilla company run by gol kolea. she was lively, playful, impetuous with close-cut curly brown hair and a figure that was a tad more rounded and feminine than that of the lithe ganger criid. rawne signalled her on with a silent gesture and she did so, with a nod and a wink. a wink! you didn't wink at your commanding officer! rawne was about to call a halt and shout into her face when waed signalled. everyone fell into shadows and cover, pressing against the hallway walls. they were reaching a turn. a wooden, red-painted door lay ahead, closed, and then further down the corridor, around the turn, there was an archway. the carpet in the halls had been racked up and was stained and stiff with dried blood. rawne's adjutant, the ruthless feygor, nodded to confirm. rawne gestured some orders in quick succession. feygor and waed moved up, hunched low, hugging the right-hand wall. bragg took the corner as cover and got his big autocannon braced. banda and mkillian went up the left side of the corridor until they reached the cover of a hardwood ottoman pushed against the wall. caffran and criid slung their lasrifles over their shoulders, drew their blunt-nosed laspistols and went to the red door. if, as seemed likely, it opened into the same room as the archway, this could open their field of fire. and double checking it covered their arses. total silence. they were all ghosts, moving with a ghost's practiced stealth. caffran grasped the door handle, turned it, but didn't open it. he held it fast as criid leaned down and put her ear to the red-painted wood. rawne saw how she brushed her bleached hair out of the way to do it. he-he was going to have to fething concentrate, he realised. rawne nodded, made sure all the squad could see him, raised three fingers and then dropped them one by one. as the third finger dropped, criid and caffran went through the door low and fast. they found themselves in a large stone chamber that had once been a scriptorium before rockets had blown out the vast lancet windows opposite the door and shattered the wooden desks and writing tables. caffran and criid dropped for cover amid the twisted wooden wreckage. las-shots spat their way from an archway at the far end of the room. at the sound of gunfire from the room, rawne's team opened up at the corridor arch. rawne snarled into his vox-link. brace for det! rawne went to the door and pushed the curtain aside. he cried, taking cover behind a mixing table. he fired through the doorway with his lasrifle and saw an infardi crash sideways into a rack of vellum, spilling the whole lot over. rawne and caffran went through the door. it was a parchment store, with no other exits. the infardi, his green robes yanked up over his face, was dead. but there was still shooting. rawne turned. it was outside in the corridor. that was feygor. rawne, criid and caffran hurried to the corridor archway, but the force of crossfire outside prevented them from sticking their heads out. las-shots smacked into the archway's jamb and ricocheted back into the annex room. rawne looked around, exasperated. criid and caffran were over by the blasted window arches in the main scriptorium. criid was peering out. caffran called to the major. rawne hurried over. criid was already up and out on the ledge, shuffling along the stone sill. caffran wasn't. he was up on the sill too, following criid. he reached a hand down for rawne. the major put his rifle strap over his shoulder and took the hand. caffran pulled him up onto the stone ledge. rawne swore silently. the air was cold. they were high up. the stone flanks of the universitariat dropped away ninety metres below the scriptorium window, straight down into the green, opaque channel of the river. above the scriptorium's sloping, tiled roof, domes and spires rose. rawne swayed for a second. criid and caffran were edging down the ledge, stepping gingerly over leaded rainwater spouts and gutter trays. rawne followed them. bas-relief wall carvings, some in the form of saints or gargoyles, all weathered by age, stuck out, in some places wider than the ledge. rawne found they had to go sidelong with their backs to the drop so they could hunch and belly around such obstructions.  he felt his foot go into nothingness and put his arms round a saint's stone neck, his heart thundering, his eyes closed. when he looked again, he could see caffran about ten metres away, but there was no sign of the girl criid. feth! had she fallen off? no. her bleached-blonde head appeared out of a window further down, urging them on. she was back inside. caffran pulled rawne in through the broken window. he ripped his kneecaps on the twisted leading and toothy stubs of glass in the frame and it took him a minute to get his breathing rate down again. he looked around. a seriously big artillery shell had taken this chamber out. it had come through the windows, blown out the floor and the floor beneath. the room had a ring of broken floorboards jutting out around the walls and a void in the centre. they worked their way round on the remains of the floor to the hallway door. the firing was now a way behind them. caffran led the way out into the corridor. the shell blast had blown the room's wooden door, complete with frame out across the hall and left it propped upright against the far wall. the three ghosts scattered back down the hall at a run, coming in behind the enemy position that was keeping the rest of their team pinned. the infardi, twenty-two of them, were dug in behind a series of barricades made from broken furniture they were blazing away, oblivious to anything behind them. rawne and caffran drew their silver tanith knives. criid pulled out her chain-dagger, a gang-marked legacy of her low-life vervunhive days. they went into the cultists from behind and eight were finished before the rest became aware of the counter-attack. then it came to hand to hand, a frantic defence. but rawne and criid had begun to open fire with their lasguns and caffran had pulled out his pistol. an infardi with a bayonet charged rawne screaming, and rawne blew his legs and belly out, but the momentum of the charge threw the body into the major and knocked him down. he tried to scramble out from under the slippery, twitching body. another infardi appeared above him, swinging down with one of those wicked, twist-bladed local axes. a headshot toppled him. rawne got up. the infardi were dead and his squad was moving up. rawne said nothing. he could see no point in mentioning that the sneak attack had been caffran's and criid's idea. in a prayer yard east of the universitariat precinct. captain ban daur was controlling traffic when he heard the colonel-commissar calling his name. colonel corbec's second front push had woken up the old town, and civilians who had been hiding there in cellars and basements for the best part of three weeks were now fleeing the quarter en masse. in the long narrow prayer yard, the tide of filthy, frightened bodies moved west in slow, choked patterns. ban daur turned and saluted gaunt. gaunt nodded. he sent mkoll and a group of tanith away into a nearby chapel and they returned with pews which they set up as saw-horses to channel the refugees away. with a glance to his men, the officer bolstered his service pistol and climbed down from the tractor. he was taller than daur, with pale, freckled skin and blond hair. greer saluted halfheartedly and called his men down off the parked vehicles. mkoll and daur quickly got them to work moving civilians off the thoroughfare. daur moved through the filthy crowd. no one made eye contact. he'd seen that shocked, war-wrecked, fatigued look before. he'd worn it himself at vervunhive. an old woman, stick-thin and frail, stumbled in the crowd and went over, spilling open a shawl full of possessions. no one stopped to help. the refugees plodded on around her, stepping over her reaching hands as she tried to recover her possessions. daur helped her up. she was as light as a bag of twigs. her hair was shockingly white and pinned back against her skull. he stooped and picked up her few belongings: prayer candles, a small icon, some beads, an old picture of a young man. he found she was looking at him with eyes filmed by age. none of them had found his eyes out like that. but i don't matter. we don't matter. she pressed something into his hand. daur looked down. it was a small figurine, made of silver, worn almost featureless. the emperor would will it of you. go! mkoll yelled across at daur, and immediately darted along from the arch towards the plinth of the nearest right-hand stelae. four of his men gave him covering fire and a couple ran after him. las-shots stitched across the walkway's flags and smacked chippings off the ancient obelisk. daur moved left, feeling the heat of a close round across his neck. he almost fell into the shadows of the nearest obelisk plinth. other ghosts tumbled in with him: lillo, mkvan and another tanith whose name he didn't know. a pardus crewman attempted to follow, but he was clipped in the knee and collapsed back into cover yelping. daur dared a look out and glimpsed green movement further down the colonnade. the heaviest fire seemed to be coming from a large building on the left side of the colonnade which daur believed was a municipal census hall. mkoll replied from the other side of the colonnade. daur watched as the scout leader and his fireteam tried to advance. withering fire drove them back into cover. daur ran again, reaching the next obelisk plinth on the left side. shots were suddenly coming across him from the right and he turned to see two infardi straddling the sloping tiles of a building, raking shots down into the shadows of the street. daur fired back, hastily, dragging his lasrifle off his shoulder. lillo and nessa reached his position around the same time and joined his fire. they didn't hit either of the infardi but they drove them back off the roof out of sight. broken tiles from the section of roof they had bombarded slithered off and crashed down onto the flagstones. mkvan reached their position too. nessa was an ex-hab worker turned guerilla and like a fair number of the verghastite volunteers, she was profoundly deaf from enemy shelling at vervunhive. signed orders were a scratch company basic. she nodded she understood, her fine, elfin features set in a determined frown as she slid a fresh ammunition cell into the port of her sniper-pattern lasgun. running stooped and low, the quartet left the main colonnade and ventured through the airy cool and shadows of a hypostyle hall. this temple, and the next which they crossed into via a small columned passage, was empty: what decoration and ornament the faithful hadn't taken and hidden prior to the invasion had been plundered by the infardi during their occupation. lamp braziers were overturned, and puddles of loose ash dotted the ceramic tiles of the floor. splintered wood from broken furniture and prayer mats was scattered around. along one east-facing wall, in a pool of sunlight cast by the hypostyle's high windows, a row of buckets and piles of rags showed where local people had attempted to scrub the infardi's heathen blasphemies off the temple walls. the four of them moved in pairs, providing bounding cover, two stationary and aiming while the other two swept forward to the next contact point.  the back of the second temple led into a subsidiary precinct that connected to the census hall. here, the walls were faced in black grandiorite, but some infardi hand had taken a sledgehammer to the ancient wall-carvings. the infardi had posted lookouts at the back of the census hall. mkvan spotted them, and brought the ghosts into cover as laser and solid shots cut into the arched doorway of the precinct and blew dusty holes in the ashlar. nessa settled and aimed. she had a good angle and two single shots brought down a couple of the enemy gunmen. daur smiled. daur and mkvan ran forward through the archway, back into the bright sunlight, and tossed tube-charges in through the rear doors of the census hall. a row of small glass windows overlooking the alley blew out simultaneously and smoke and dust rolled back out of the doors. the four ghosts went in, knives fixed as bayonets, firing short bursts into the smoke. they came into the infardi position from behind. the intense firefight began to split the airy interior of the census hall. daur's strike immediately diluted the infardi barrage from the front of the building, allowing the pinned forces in the colonnade ample chance to push in. three fireteams of ghosts, including mkoll's, circled in down the colonnade. by then, gaunt had moved up to the front line amongst the stelae. gaunt crouched behind a stelae and waved a signal down the line of crouching ghosts ranged along the side of the colonnade. trooper brostin ran forward, the tanks of his flamer unit clanking. brostin, a big man with ursine shoulders and a ragged, bushy moustache, who always reeked of promethium, hefted the flamer around and thumbed the firing toggle the tanks made a coughing gurgle and then retched a spear of liquid fire out at the census hall. the jet of flame arced downwards with yellow tongues and noxious black smoke curling off it like a mane. fire drizzled and trickled across the boarded front of the hall. painted panels suddenly scorched black and caught fire. paint peeled and beaded in the heat. the tie-beams over the door burst into flames. brostin took a few steps forward and squirted flame directly in through some of the tight firing slits in the hall's defences. gaunt liked watching brostin work. the burly trooper had an affinity with fire, an understanding of the way it ran and danced and leapt. he could make it work for him; he knew what would combust quickly and what slowly, what would burst in fierce incandescent flames and what would smoulder; he knew how to use wind and breeze to fan flames up into target dugouts. brostin wasn't just hosing an enemy emplacement with flames here he was artfully building an inferno. according to sergeant varl, brostin's skill with fire came from his background as a firewatcher in tanith magna. gaunt could believe this. it wasn't what trooper larkin said, though. larkin said brostin was an ex-convict with a ten-year sentence for arson. the fire, almost white, coiled up the hall front and caught the roof. a significant section of the front wall blew out into the street as fire touched off something volatile, perhaps an infardi's satchel of grenades. another section guttered and fell in. three green-dad men came out of the hall door mouth, firing las-weapons down the colonnade. the robes of one of the trio were burning. ghost weapons opened up all around and the three toppled. a couple of grenades flew from the burning hall and exploded in the middle of the street. then two more infardi tried to break out. mkoll killed both within seconds of them appearing at the doorway. now, under gaunt's orders, the ghosts were firing into the burning facade. a pardus hydra platform clanked down the centre of the colonnade, trailing a bunch of prayer-kite tails that had snagged on its barrels and aerial mount and rolled in beside gaunt's position. the gunner tipped a salute and then tore the front of the census hall into burning scraps with his unforgiving firepower. inside, at the rear of the hall, daur and his comrades were moving back the way they had come in. thick black smoke boiled out from the main body of the hall. daur, choking, could smell promethium and knew a flamer had been put to good work. now there was a hell of a noise out front. �ayatani blessing his father turned from the workbench , put down a greasy spanner and smiled at him as he wiped his oily hands on a rag. the machine shop smelled of cog-oil, promethium and cold metal. he held out the piping hot cup of caffeine, a cup so big his small hands clutched it like a chalice, and his father took it gratefully. it was dawn, and the autumn sun was gliding up over the stands of massive nalwood trees beyond the lane that led down from the river road to his father's machine shop. the men had arrived at dusk the previous night, eight raw-palmed men from the timber reserve fifteen leagues down river. they had a big order to meet for a cabinet maker in tanith magna and their main woodsaw had thrown its bearings. a real emergency� could the best mechanic in pryze county help them out? the men from the reserve had brought the saw up on a flatbed wagon, and they helped his father roll it back into the workshop. his father had sent him to light all the lamps. it was going to be a late hour before work would be finished. he waited in the doorway of the shop as his father made a last few adjustments to the woodsaw's big motor and then screwed the grille cover back in place. collected sawdust had spilled out of the recesses of the cover and the room was suddenly perfumed with the pungent fragrance of nalwood. as he waited for his father to test the saw, he felt his heart beating fast. it had been the same as long as he could remember, the excitement of watching his father perform magic, of watching his father take dead lumps of metal and put them together and make them live. it was a magic he hoped he'd inherit one day, so that he could take over when his father had done with working. so that he'd be the machinesmith. his heart was beating so fast now, it hurt. his chest hurt. he clutched the doorframe to steady himself. his father threw the switch on the sawblock and the machine shrilled into life. its rasping shriek rattled around the shop. the pain in his chest was quite real now. he gasped. it was all down one side, down the left, across his ribs. he tried to call out to his father, but his voice was too weak and the noise of the running saw too loud. he was going to die, he realised. he was going to die there in the doorway of his father's machine shop in pryze county with the smell of nalwood in his nose and the sound of a woodsaw in his ears and a great big spike of impossible pain driving into his heart� colm corbec opened his eyes and added a good thirty-five years to his life. he wasn't a boy anymore. he was an old soldier with a bad wound in a grim, grim situation. he'd been stripped to the waist, with the filthy remnants of his undershirt still looped about his shoulders. he'd lost a boot. where the feth his equipment and vox-link had gone was anybody's guess. blood, scratches and bruises covered his flesh. he tried to move and pain felled him back. corbec looked around and saw yael beside him. the young tanith trooper was ash-white and sat with his back against a crumbling brick wall. he too had been stripped down to his breeches and dried blood caked his shoulders. corbec looked around. they were sprawled together in the old, dead fireplace of a grand room that the war had brutally visited. the walls were shattered skins of plaster that showed traces of old decorations and painting, and the once-elegant windows were boarded. light stabbed in through slits between the planks. the last thing corbec remembered was storming into the guild hall. this, as far as he could tell, wasn't the guild hall at all. corbec shut up fast as he followed yael's look and saw the infardi. there were dozens of them, scurrying into the room through a doorway out of sight to his left. some took up positions at the windows, weapons ready. others moved in, carrying ammo crates and bundles of equipment. four were manhandling a long and obviously heavy bench into the room. the feet of the bench scraped on the stone floor. the infardi spoke to each other in dull, low voices. now he began to remember. he remembered the four of them taking the main chamber of the guild hall. god emperor, but they'd punished those cultist scum! kolea had fought like a daemon, leyr and yael at his side. corbec remembered pressing ahead with yael, calling to kolea to cover them. and then� and then pain. a las-shot from almost point-blank range from an infardi playing dead in the rubble. yael was shaking slightly, and corbec noticed that one of the boy's pupils was more dilated than the other. he saw the back of yael's head and froze.  how was the boy still alive? he was about to say something else, but he fell suddenly dumb as a sigh wafted through the room. corbec felt it rather than heard it. the infardi gunmen had gone quiet and were backing to the edges of the chamber beyond the fireplace, heads bowed. something came into the room, something the shape, perhaps, of a large man, if a man can be clothed in a whisper. it was something like a large, upright patch of heat haze, fogging and distorting the air, humming like the low throb of a drowsy hornet's nest. corbec stared at the shape. he could smell the way it blistered reality around itself, smell that cold hard scent of the warp. the shape was simultaneously translucent and solid: vapour-frail but as hard as imperator armour. the more corbec looked, the more he saw in the haze. tiny shapes, twinkling, seething, moving and humming like a billion insects. with another sigh, the refractor shield disengaged and dissolved, revealing a large figure wrapped in green silk robes. the compact generator pack for the body-shield swung from a belt harness. it turned to face the two guard prisoners in the empty fireplace. well over two metres, built of corded muscle, with skin, where it showed past the rich emerald silk, decorated with the filthy tattoos of the infardi cult. pater sin smiled down at colm corbec. sin nodded and his grin broadened. an image of the emperor tortured and agonised was tattooed across his left cheek and forehead, with sin's bloodshot left eye forming the screaming mouth. sin's teeth were sharpened steel implants. he smelled of sweat and cinnamon and decay. he hunched down in front of corbec. corbec could feel yael quaking with fear beside him. outside, everyone was on their feet. a group of tanith ghosts had appeared from the direction of the fighting down in the merchant market, carrying trooper leyr on a makeshift stretcher. gol kolea was running beside the prostrate man. there was shouting and confusion. calmly, dorden pushed his way through the mob and got the stretcher down on the ground so he could look. the man was hurt, battered, covered in minor wounds and semi-conscious, but he wouldn't die. dorden stopped his work abruptly and looked up at the big verghastite. the men all around went quiet. we were doing pretty well but there were too many. i got out with leyr here, but colonel corbec and the lad� they got them. alive. as we shot our way out of the hall, leyr saw the bastards dragging both of them away. said trooper domor, stunned and miserable. dorden shook his head. he didn't agree with the brave verghastite's assessment. kolea snapped. hands went up all around. said dorden. he moved forward and checked the minor wounds on kolea's face and chest. dorden nodded. dorden gathered up a makeshift kit and hurried after the troopers moving out of the square. the lips of lord general lugo's three-dimensional holographic image moved out of sync with his utterance. lugo was speaking via vox-pictor from imperial base command at ansipar city, six hundred and forty kilometres south-west of the doctrinopolis, and atmospherics were causing a communications lag. but the colonel himself will tell you the infardi put up little outer resistance. they didn't want to meet our armour head on. they fell back into the doctrinopolis where the density of the buildings would work to their advantage. the vox crackled. gaunt sighed. he glanced around at his fellow officers: major kleopas, the squat, plump, ageing second-incommand of the pardus armour; captain herodas, the pardus' infantry liaison officer; major szabo of the brevian centennials. none of them looked comfortable. herodas cut in. let me tell you now that we are all but done here at ansipar. the city is burning and the shrines are ours. my troops are rounding up the enemy stragglers for execution as we speak. furthermore, colonel cerno reports his forces are within a day of taking hylophan. colonel paquin raised the aquila above the royal palace at hetshapsulis yesterday. only the doctrinopolis remains in enemy hands. i gave you the job of taking it because of your reputation, gaunt. he pulled down one of the metal frame slouch-seats from the wall of the tractor hull, sat his rotund bulk down and scratched at the scar tissue around the augmetic implant that served as his left eye. herodas went to fetch them all caffeine from the stove rack by the rear hatch. gaunt took off his peaked and braided cap, set it on the edge of the chart display and tossed his leather gloves into it. he knew well what kleopas meant. some, like the great urienz, had proved themselves just as able as the slaydo favourites they replaced. others had proved only that they were book-learned tacticians with years of campaign in the war-libraries of terra and none at the front line. lord general lugo was desperate to prove himself, gaunt knew. he'd botched command of his first theatre, oscillia ix, turning a sure-thing into a twenty-month debacle, and there were rumours that an enquiry was pending following his lightning raids on the hives of karkariad. he needed a win, and a victor's medal on his chest, and he needed them quickly before macaroth decided he was dead weight. the liberation of hagia was to have been given to lord militant general bulledin, which was why gaunt had gladly approved his ghosts for the action. but at the last minute, presumably after much petitioning behind the scenes by lugo's faithful, macaroth had replaced bulledin and put lugo in charge. hagia was meant to be an easy win and lugo wanted it. asked szabo as he took a cup from herodas. he wants the doctrinopolis taken in the next few days and he'll make us scapegoats for any delay. sir? thank you, milo. gentlemen. my trooper here has undoubtedly explained the sad news i bear. he was a tall man, bald save for a silver goatee. his eyes were immeasurably weary. the honour of saint sabbat is one of the primary reasons for our crusade to retake her home-world is my chief concern. gaunt listened to kilosh's words and turned to look out past the jagged roofs of the old town towards the towering plateau of the inner citadel. it was swathed in smoke, the white after-fog of heavy mortar shelling wisping away into the windy blue air. sanian bowed her head in respect. milo turned to the old priest. gugai was by far the most ancient of the four priests sanian had found for him. his skin was wizened and deeply scored with innumerable lines. his eyes were clouding and dim, and his body, beneath the blue silk robes, was twisted and hunched from a lifetime that had been both long and hard. explain it to the off-worlder, esholi. gugai said with contempt. so you have yet to find your� way? yes. i am esholi yet. but she rose, the best part of six years in the sabbat worlds crusade had told milo that much. saint sabbat had, six thousand years before, come from poverty on this colony world to command imperial forces and achieve victory throughout the cluster, driving the forces of evil out. he had seen images of her, bare-headed and tonsured, dressed in imperator armour, decapitating the daemons of filth with her luminous sword. milo realised the girl and the old priest were staring at him. gugai stared some more and then shook his head. milo was about to reply when his earpiece squawked and combat traffic crackled into his link. he hurried towards gaunt who stood with the other imperial officers at the rear steps of the command tractor. sunlight barred down between the high roofs of the temple district and made pools on the otherwise dark street. rat-birds, their plumage grey and dirty, fluttered between the eaves or roosted and gurgled in the gutters. as milo strode towards gaunt he could see that the tanith commander was listening to his own headset. there were many things brin milo wanted to say.  most of them were about colm corbec. but the look of colonel- commissar gaunt's face denied them all. sir? signal him a �no', gak take you! rafflan sat down in a corner of the ruined old town dwelling they had secured. trooper domor and four others moved past to the cracked and bare windows and aimed their lasguns. the old doctor, dorden, weighed down with his medicae kit and loose-fitting black smock, was last into the building. the men looked round from their positions. dorden settled in beside kolea on the slope of plaster and rubble under the window. mkvenner and sergeant haller called back that the street was clean. come on! lay a fire within your soul and another between your hands, and let both be your weapons. � saint sabbat, lessons the room shook. the walls and floor jarred slightly. dust dribbled from the rafters. onion-flasks full of water clinked against each other. no one seemed to notice at first, except corbec himself. he was sprawled on the floor, and he could feel the flagstones stirring under his palms and fingertips. he looked up, but none of the infardi had felt it. they were too busy with yael. the boy was dead now; for that much corbec was thankful, though it meant it would soon be his own turn on the bench. but the infardi were still finishing their ritual butchery, adorning the corpse with shunned symbols while they muttered verses from polluted texts. the room shook again. the bottles clinked. more dust trickled down. despite the gravity of his situation, perhaps even because of it colm corbec smiled. a shadow fell across him. pater sin asked. sin's voice was low, almost breathless. he sat up slightly. sin made several guttural noises � corbec decided they must be command words in the infardi's private combatcode � and the gunmen made ready to leave en masse. four of them grabbed corbec and dragged him up with them. pain flared through his torso, but he bit his lip. his captors pulled and shoved him along dirty hallways and across an open courtyard behind the main body of the infardi gunmen. in the yard, the sunlight was harsh and painful to corbec, and the open air brought the sounds of the imperial assault to him with greater clarity: the overlapping, meaty thump of explosions, the swooping air-rush of shells, the clanking grind of tracks, the slithering collapses of masonry. corbec found himself almost hopping along, trying to favour the foot with the boot on it. the infardi punched and jabbed him, cursing him.  they wanted to move faster than he could go. besides, keeping one hand on him meant they each had only one hand free to manage ammo satchels, las-rifles and their other accoutrements. they pressed on through the interior of a stonecutter's workshop where everything was coated thumb-deep in white stone dust, before emerging through a set of wooden shutters into a steep, cobbled street. above, not more than two kilometres away, rose the citadel. it was the closest corbec had been to the building. its bleached cliff edges, fringed in mauve mosses and feathery lichens, thrust up above the skirt of roofs and towers formed by old town and the eastern hill quarters of the doctrinopolis, supporting the ashlar-dressed pillars and temples of the holy city's royal precincts. the monumental buildings were flesh-pink against the blue of the sky. sin's men must have taken him and yael a good way north through the old town. looking the other way, the street swept down through the jumbled old dwellings and massy stoneshops towards the river plain where the old town started. the sky that way was a whirling haze of black and grey smoke. fire licked through the town's flanks. corbec could see series after series of shell-strikes fan in ripples through the streets. geysers of flame, smoke, earth and masonry blew up into the air. his guards pulled at him again and forced him up the slope of the street. most of the other infardi had already disappeared into the surrounding buildings. the gunmen jostled him off the street, through a cast-iron gate into a level yard where stones and tiles were stacked ready for use. to one side, under an awning, sat three flat-pan work barrows and some cutter's tools; to the other, a pair of heavy old-pattern servitors that had been deactivated. the men pushed corbec down on the barrows. pater sin reappeared with eight other men, moving from an inner door across the yard, and words were exchanged. corbec waited. the barrows were covered in dusty sacking. the masons' tools were nearby: four big adzes, a worn mallet, some chisels, a diamond-bladed trowel. even the smaller items were not small enough for him to conceal. a whistling scream shook the yard as a shell passed directly overhead. it detonated in the neighbouring building and blew brick chips and smoke back over them with a boneshaking roar. corbec pressed his head down into the sacking. he felt something under the sacking, reached for it. a heavy weight, small, about the size of a child's fist or a ripe ploin, with a cord attached. a stonecutter's plumbline; a hard lead weight on the end of four metres of plaited silk string. trying not to let them see, he tugged it out of the sacking on the barrow and wound it into his hand. pater sin barked some more orders to his men, and then engaged his body-shield, effectively vanishing from view. corbec saw his hazy shape, crackling in the dustclouds kicked up from the near-hit, leave the yard by the far side, accompanied by all but three of the men. they turned back to him, approaching. a salvo of tank shells fell on the street around with numbing force and noise. luck alone had caused them to bracket the yard or, corbec realised, he and his captors would have been pulped. as it was, all three infardi were knocked over on their faces. corbec, who had a more experienced ear for shelling times and distances than the cultists, had braced himself at the first whistle of the incoming shells. he leapt up. one of the infardi was already rising groggily, lasrifle swinging up to cover the prisoner. corbec spun the looped plumb-line in his hand quickly, letting the lead soar free on the third turn. it smashed into the gunman's left cheek with a satisfying crack and sent him tumbling back to the floor. corbec now spun the line over his head at the full length of its cord. he had built up enough force by the time the second gunman jumped up that it wrapped four times around his throat and cinched tight. choking, the cultist fell, trying to get the tough, tight cord off his throat. corbec grabbed his lasrifle, and managed to roll with it and fire off a pair of shots as the first infardi got up again. he was firing as he rose, the dent of the plumb-weight braising his face. corbec's shots went through his chest and tossed him over on to his back. clutching his captured weapon, corbec stood up. more shells fell close by. he put a shot through the head of the infardi who was still trying to get the line off his neck. the third was face down, dead. the close blast had buried a piece of tile in his skull. the rolling thunder of the barrage was coming closer. there was no time to search the bodies for ammo or liberate a replacement boot. corbec figured if he headed up the old town hill he could get around the side of the citadel plateau and perhaps stay alive. it was undoubtedly what the infardi were doing. he went through the doors on the far side of the yard, in the direction sin had taken. he kept hopping as shards of debris dug into the sole of his unprotected foot. he passed down a tiled hallway where the force of the blasts had brought the windows and blinds in, then on into a bay area where iron scaffolding was stored near to a loading ramp. between the beat of explosions, close and distant he heard voices. corbec crouched and peered through the loading area. the outer doors, tall and old and wooden, had been levered open, and a pair of eight-wheel cargo tracks had been backed in. infardi, about a dozen of them, were loading sheet-wrapped objects and wooden crates into the rear of the vehicles. there was no sign of pater sin. corbec checked the power-load of his appropriated weapon. over three-quarters yield. enough to make them sit up and take notice at least. the burning streets were alive. humans, locals, fleeing from their devastated homes and hiding places with bundles of possessions, driving thin, scared livestock before them. and vermin� tides of vermin� pouring out of the inferno, sweeping down the hill streets of old town towards the river. kolea's team moved against the tide. chasing uphill at a ran, with rebreather masks buckled over their faces to shut out the searing smoke, they tried to head away from the blast front of the encroaching armour brigade while steering a path towards the masons' district. now and then, shells fell so close they were all thrown off their feet by the shockwaves torched dwellings collapsed across streets to block their route. in places, they waded through living streams of rodents, guard-issue boots crunching on squirming bodies. the eight ghosts sprinted across another street junction, wafer-shreds of ash billowing around them, and took shelter in a leather worker's shop. it had been gutted by shells, just an empty ruin. dorden pulled off his rebreather and started coughing. he used his medicae kit tweezers to tug the sliver out and washed the deep cut with antiseptic from a spray bottle. dorden nodded the question away. he felt half-cooked, wilted, choked. he couldn't draw breath properly. the heat from the burning buildings all around was like an oven. by an exploded doorway in the far wall, kolea and sergeant haller looked out. he waved up troopers garond and cuu and sent them dashing over to secure the premises next door. dorden noted that haller, a verghastite recruit himself, and a veteran of the vervun primary regiment favoured the troops he knew from his homeworld: garond and cuu, both verghastites. haller was a cautious soul. dorden felt the sergeant sometimes had too much respect for the heroic tanith to give them orders. the old medic eyed the other members of the squad: mkvenner, wheln, domor and rafflan, the other tanith men. harjeon was the only other vervunhiver. a small, blond man with a wispy moustache, harjeon cowered in the shelled out corner of the premises. dorden noted he could see a pecking order now. kolea's in charge, and he's a war hero, so no one argues. haller's ex-hive military, and so's garond. cuu� well, he's a law unto himself, an ex-ganger from the lowest hive levels, but no one doubts his mettle or his fighting smarts. harjeon� an ex-civilian. dorden wasn't sure what harjeon's calling had been in pre-guard life. a tailor? a teacher? whatever, he rated lowest of all. if they ever got out of this alive, dorden knew he'd have to talk to gaunt about evening up the prejudices that the new influx brought with them. volcanically, shells splashed down across the end of the street. they were showered with debris. haller cried and took off after cuu and garond. kolea waited, waving harjeon and the tanith past. dorden reached the doorway, and looked at kolea as he adjusted his rebreather mask. kolea asked, gesturing back at the firestorm that boiled up through old town after them. dorden knew domor well, and counted him a friend. he knew that domor's implants could read heat and movement through stone walls and brick facades. kolea should put me up front. dorden nodded. mkvenner was one of the tanith's elite scout troopers, trained by the infamous mkoll himself. between his senses and domor's augmetic sight, they could be moving ahead with a great deal more confidence. dorden decided to speak to kolea and haller about it. he moved forward towards the bulky shape of the big miner and the lean figure of haller, who still wore his spiked vervun primary helmet as part of his battledress. a shockwave threw him off his feet into the far wall. plaster smashed and slid away as he hit it. for a fleeting, peaceful second, he saw his wife, and his daughter, long gone with tanith itself and his son mikal, dead these last few months on verghast far away� mikal smiled, and detached himself from the embrace of his sister and his mother. dorden replied. his mouth and nose were full of blood and he couldn't talk clearly. the joy and pain of seeing his son was making him cry. dorden opened his eyes. pain shuddered through his waking body. rough hands yanked his mask off and he heard liquid pattering on the rubble. he blinked. wheln cried. they helped him sit up. dorden wiped his face and saw his hand came away bloody. he checked his face and realised his nose was streaming blood. he snarled, getting up. his head swam and he sat back. with the help of wheln and haller, dorden got to his feet. he felt like the spirit had been blasted out of him. kolea asked. dorden spat clotted blood and wiped his face. kolea nodded, and signalled the party to their feet. firestorms were ripping down both sides of the street by them, and further shells were adding to the inferno. behind the dwelling, they found that the shell had blown open a watercourse gurgling below street level in a brick defile. kolea and mkvenner leapt down into it. the brackish water, perhaps an ancient tributary of the holy river, surged around their boots. dorden followed them down. no one argued. in a tight line, the seven ghosts tracked up the watercourse through the fires. they'd gone no more than a hundred metres when trooper cuu suddenly held up his hand. corbec's shots tore through the loading bay. two infardi were slammed back off the side of one of the trucks.  another toppled, dropping the crate he had been carrying. they started firing back almost immediately, pulling handguns from their sashes or grabbing the lasrifles leaning up against the wall. glittering laser fire and whining hard rounds hammered into the stacked scaffolding around corbec. he didn't flinch. kicking over a stack of scaffolding, he ran down the length of the bay's side wall, firing from the hip. another infardi clutched his throat, fell on his back and slithered off the bed of one of the trucks. a bullet creased his tricep. a las-round tore through the thigh pocket of his combat pants. he threw himself into cover behind an archway pillar. it went unpleasantly quiet. gunsmoke and the coppery stink of las discharge filled the air. corbec lay still, trying to slow his breathing. he could hear them moving around. an infardi came around the pillar and corbec shot him through the face. a torrent of shots poured in his direction and the tanith colonel started to crawl on his hands and knees down the stone passage. the wood-panelled walls above began to splinter and shred into the air as solid and energy rounds rained into them. there was a doorway to his left. he rolled across into it, and got up. his hands were shaking. his chest hurt so much he could barely think any longer. the room was an office of some sort. there were book cases and a large clerical desk lined with pigeon holes. sheets of paper coated the floor, some fluttering in the breeze from the small, broken window high in the end wall. there was no way out. i just hope they don't have grenades, he thought. another infardi ducked in, fired twice with his lasgun and jumped back out. not fast enough. corbec's shot didn't kill him but it went through his arm. he could hear whimpering outside. now a lasgun came around the doorframe, held out blind and firing. two shots hit the desk hard enough to jerk it back against him. he shot back and the gun disappeared. now he could smell something. an intense chemical stink. liquid promethium. they had a flamer out there. gol kolea snapped his fingers and made three quick gestures. mkvenner, harjeon and haller sprinted forward to the left, down the side of the stonemason's shop. domor, rafflan and garond ran right, around to the gaping entrance of the loading bay that opened onto the narrow back street. cuu headed forward, jumped up onto a rainwater tank and from there swung up onto the sloping roof. with dorden at his heels, kolea moved after them. the chatter of las and solid firing from inside the buildings was audible over the roar of the advancing tank assault down the hill behind them. domor, rafflan and garond rushed the bay doors, firing tight bursts. they came in on half a dozen infardi who turned in abject surprise to meet their deaths. mkvenner, harjeon and haller kicked in big leaded windows and fired into the bay, cutting down a trio of infardi who were running back through, alerted by the sudden firing. cuu shot in a skylight and began picking off targets below. kolea went in through a side door, firing twice to drop an infardi trying to flee that way. dorden watched the ghosts at work with awe. it was a stunning display of precision tactics, exactly the sort of work that the tanith first-and-only was famous for. caught from several angles at once, the enemy panicked and started to die. one of the trucks spluttered into life and spun its heavy wheels as it started to speed out of the bay. domor and rafflan were in its way, and stood their ground, firing their lasguns from the shoulder, peppering the cab. garond, to the side, raked the vehicle as it ran past. sharp-edged punctures stung the cab's metalwork. the windows shattered. it veered drunkenly, smashing a crate waiting to be stacked and rolling over the sprawled corpses of two infardi with nauseating crunches. at the last moment, rafflan and domor dived aside. the truck sped right across the back alley and battered nosefirst into the opposite wall, which caved in around it. rafflan and domor advanced into the bay, joining up with garond and then with kolea and dorden. the soldiers formed a straggled knot, firing safety shots into corners where the collecting weapon-smoke blocked vision. dorden felt his pulse racing. he felt exposed, and more, he felt elated. to be part of this. killing was misery and war was a bestial waste, but glory and valour� they were something else. pleasures so intense and so fundamentally contiguous with the horrors he abominated, they made him feel guilty to cherish them. at times like this, he understood why mankind made war, and why it celebrated its warriors above all others. at times like this he could understand gaunt himself. he cried, leaping back, and a moment later fire gouted out of the passageway mouth. we're coming at you from the east. he reported, gleefully. he crept forward. who's that? corbec limped cautiously out of the doorway, gun raised, glancing around. they were seated on crates in the bay while the other ghosts regrouped. cuu and wheln were checking bodies. kolea shook his head. outside, the tremulous rumble of the armour wave was closer. kolea didn't reply. dorden supported corbec as he shuffled over to the bay doors. the colonel took a long look down the hill at the nightmare of fire and destruction moving up towards them. true, but i rate our chances that way higher. corbec shook his head. haller got up into the cab of the truck and turned the engine over. on the flatbed, harjeon had opened one of the crates. he called. the crate was full of icons and holy statuettes, prayer texts, reliquaries. the men opened the other crates and found them all to be full of similar artefacts. kolea shrugged. the ghosts climbed up into the rear of the truck. haller took the wheel with wheln riding shotgun beside him. they met no resistance. the storm assault of the pardus tanks had broken the back of the infardi grip on the doctrinopolis. sixteen square kilometres of the city, the areas of old town flanking the noble plateau, were on fire and dead. scout recons estimated what little numbers the infardi could still muster had fled north, out of the city and into the rainwoods of the hinterland. a victory, gaunt realised, as szabo's initial reports were relayed to him by the vox-operator. they had taken the doctrinopolis and driven the foe out. pockets of resistance remained � there was a hell of a street fight raging in the western suburbs � and it would take months to hunt out the infardi who had gone to ground outside the city. but it was a victory. lord general lugo would be pleased. or at least satisfied. in short order, szabo's men would raise the imperial standard above the citadel, and under the fluttering aquila, the place would be theirs again. hagia was theirs. a world liberated. gaunt climbed down from the command tractor and wandered alone down the street. he felt oddly out of sorts. there had been precious little glory in this theatre. his men had acquitted themselves well, of course, and he was happy to see the tanith working confidently and efficiently alongside the verghastite newcomers. but it hadn't gone the way he would have liked. it might have cost him more in time and casualties, but he resented the fact that lugo hadn't allowed him to clear old town and make a clean job of it. the pardus were exemplary soldiers, and they'd cracked this nut. but the city had suffered unnecessarily. he stood alone for a while in a prayer yard, watching the votive flags and kites dancing in the wind. the yard was littered with chips of stained glass thrown out when tank shells had gutted a nearby shrine. this was the sacred bead's world, saint sabbat's world. he would have taken it whole, out of respect for her, not ruined it to crush the foe. the darkening evening sky was thick with sooty smoke. thanks to lugo and his hunger for victory, they had razed a third of one of the most holy sites in the imperium. he would resent this all his life, he realised. if lugo had left him alone, he could have liberated the doctrinopolis and left it standing. macaroth would hear of this. gaunt stepped into the cold silence of the ruined shrine and removed his brocaded cap before advancing down the temple aisle. glass shards cracked under his jack boots with every pace. he reached the altar and knelt down. sabbat martyr! gaunt started and looked round. the whisper had come from right behind him, in his ear. there was no one in sight. his imagination� he settled back onto one knee. he wanted to make his peace with the saint in this holy place, to see if he could make amends for the excessive way they had driven out the infidel. and there was corbec too, a loss that he would really feel. but his mouth was dry. the words of the imperial catechism would not form. he tried to relax, and his mind sought out the words of the throne grace he'd been taught as a child at the scholam progenium on ignatius cardinal. even that simple, elementary prayer would not come. gaunt cleared his throat. the wind moaned through the broken window lights. he bowed his head and� sabbat martyr! the hiss again, right beside him. sir! vox-trooper beltayn was running frantically in through the temple doors, his vox-set falling off his shoulder and swinging round on its strap to bump against the end of the pews. awry. beltayn's favourite word, always used as a masterpiece of understatement. � brevia one. zero resistance in the citadel. it's damn quiet. szabo cried. he reached out. the smell was getting stronger, a thousand times more intense. time seemed to be slowing down. he watched his own hand as he reached it out in front of him. how slow! time and the very air around them seemed to have become treacle-thick and heavy. he saw his men, slowed down in time like insects in sap. some half-fallen, limbs outstretched, some convulsing, some on their knees. perfect, glinting droplets of blood hung in the air. someone had done this. someone had been ready. they'd stripped the shrines of their holy, warding charms. and left something else in their place. szabo yelled into the vox. his mouth was full of blood. there were maggots in the blood. time stopped dead. over the doctrinopolis, night fell prematurely. in a flare of blue light, like the petals of a translucent orchid a kilometre across, the citadel exploded. �dedication on the high altar of the tempelum infarfarid sabbat the citadel burned for many days. it burned without flames, or at least without any flames known to mankind. mistblue and frost-green tongues of incandescent energy leapt kilometres into the air like some flailing part of an aurora display anchored to the plateau. they fluttered helplessly in the wind. their glare cast long shadows in daylight, and illuminated the night. at their base, the blues and greens became white hot a blistering inferno that utterly consumed the temples and buildings of the citadel, and the heat could be felt half a kilometre away down the hillslopes. no one could approach closer than that. the few scout squads that ventured nearer were driven back by nausea, spontaneous bleeding or paroxysms of insane fear. observations made from a safe distance by scopes or magnoculars revealed that the stone cliffs of the plateau were melting and twisting. rock bubbled and deformed. one observer went mad, raving that he'd seen screaming faces form and loom out of the oozing stone. at the end of the first day, a delegation of local ayatani and ecclesiarchs from the imperial guard retinues set up temporary shrines around the slopes of the citadel and began a vigil of supplication, appeasement and banishment. a dismal mood of defeat settled on the doctrinopolis. this was an unparalleled disaster, worse even than the infardi's annexation of the holy city. this was desecration. this was the darkest possible omen. gaunt was withdrawn. his mood was black and few dared to disturb him, even his most trusted ghosts. he lurked in private chambers in the universitariat, brooding and reviewing reports. he slept wretchedly. even the news that corbec had been recovered, injured but alive, failed to lift his spirits much. many believed that gaunt's mood was so dark he would now mete severe punishment on kolea's unit for disobeying the withdrawal orders, despite the fact they had saved the colonel. the ayatani conducted a service of thanksgiving for the holy icons and relics kolea's unit had brought back in the captured truck. it was a small, redemptive consolation in the face of the citadel's destruction. the items were solemnly rededicated and placed in the basilica of macharius hagio at the edge of the old town. the surviving brevians, two brigades who had not deployed into the citadel with szabo, entered into a ritual of remorseful fasting and mourning. a mass funeral oration was made on the second day, during which the roll of the fallen was read out name by name. gaunt attended, in full dress uniform, but spoke to no one. the guns of the pardus armour thundered the salute. on the morning of the fourth day, brin milo crossed the square of sublime tranquillity and hurried up the steps of the universitariat's south gate with a feeling of dread inside him. tanith sentries at the gatehouse let him past and he walked through echoing halls and drafty chambers where teams of esholi worked in silence to salvage what they could of the books, papers and manuscripts the infardi had left torn and scattered in the ransacked rooms. he saw sanian, industriously picking paper scraps from a litter of glass chips under a shattered window, but she didn't acknowledge him. afterwards, he wondered if it had actually been her. with their white robes and shaved heads, the female esholi affected an alarming uniformity. he turned at a cloister corner, trotted up a set of stone stairs under the watchful, oil-painted stares of several ex- universitariat principals, and crossed a landing to a pair of wooden doors. milo took a deep breath, tossed the folds of his camo-cape over his shoulder and knocked. the door opened. caffran pointed to the empty wine bottles. milo's unease grew. he'd been worried about disturbing gaunt when his mood was bad. no one wanted to confront an ill-disposed imperial commissar. but now he was worried about gaunt himself. he'd never been a drinker. he'd always had such great composure and confidence. like all commissars, he had been created to inspire and uplift. caffran backed off with a shrug and soric pointedly refused to look up from his dog-eared cards. the inner chambers were dark and quiet. the drapes were drawn and there was an unpleasantly musty smell. feth! it's me, sir! gaunt stared at milo for a moment, as if he didn't recognise him, and then turned away, tossing his gun onto a couch. he was wearing only his jackboots and uniform breeches, and his braces dangled slackly around his hips. milo glimpsed the massive scar across gaunt's trim belly, the old wound he had taken at dercius' hands on khed 1173. gaunt lit an oil lamp with clumsy fingers and sat down on a tub chair. he began leafing urgently through an old, hidebound tome. gazing at the book, he reached out without looking to snatch up a glass tumbler from a side table. he took a deep swig of wine and set it down again. milo moved closer. he saw the stacks of unread military communiqu�s piled by the chair. the lord general is on his way. this. the gospel of saint sabbat. i felt sure there would be an answer in here. i've been through it line by line. to this� monstrous disaster. feth. gaunt snapped impatiently, pointing to a sideboard where numerous bottles and old glasses stood. gaunt snapped venomously and got up, tossing the book to milo as he strode over to the sideboard. feth you! caffran asked as milo stepped out of the inner rooms and closed the doors behind him. milo just shook his head and walked on, out through the ruined hallways of the universitariat, into the windy sunlight. ten minutes before noon, the sound of distant rotors thumped across the doctrinopolis. five dots appeared in the sky to the south-west, but in the glare of the citadel fire it was hard to resolve them. major rawne nodded and smoothed the front of his clean battledress, made sure the campaign medals were spotless, and carefully put on his cap. he took one last look at himself in the full-length mirror. despite the crazed cracks in it, he could tell he still looked every fething centimetre the acting first officer of the tanith first regiment. he turned, and strode out of the derelict dressmaker's shop that had served as his ready room. feygor, rawne's adjutant, whistled and fell in step beside him. feygor smiled. feygor, his own matt-black ghost battle dress immaculate, double-timed and took his place at the end of the ghost file. rawne joined the officers. furst nodded to him and herodas stepped back to make room. the band started to play. rawne winced every time they missed the repeated harmonic minor in the refrain. all four officers coughed as they stifled their laughter. the lord general's transport approached. the four ornithopter gunships flying escort thundered overhead, tearing the air with the beating chop of their massive rotors. they were painted ash-grey with a leopard pattern of khaki blotches. rawne admired their power, and the bulbous gun turrets on their chins and the ends of their elongated tails. lord general lugo's aircraft was a massive delta wing with a spherical glass cockpit at the prow. it was matt silver with beige jag-stripes and yellow chevrons on the wingtips alongside the imperial aquila. its shadow fell across the honour guard as it paused in mid-air and the giant jet turbines slowly cranked around in their gimbal mounts from a horizontal position. with jets now flaring downwards, the huge transport descended, whirling up dust and extending delicate landing struts from cavities in the underwing. it bounced slightly once, settled, and the screaming jets slowly powered down. a ramp set flush into the sky-blue painted belly gently unfolded and seven figures emerged. lord general lugo strolled down the ramp, a tall, bony man in a white dress uniform, his chest burdened by the weight of medals on it. at his heels, two battle-armoured troopers in red and black from the imperial crusade staff marched in escort, hellguns raised. behind them came a towering, stick-thin woman of advancing years dressed in the black leather and red braid of the imperial tacticians, two colonels from the ardelean colonials with glittering breastplates and bright sashes of orange satin, and a thickset man in the uniform of an imperial commissar. the group advanced across the concourse and saluted the visitors. lugo eyed them all suspiciously, particularly rawne. dressed in full ceremonial uniform, ibram gaunt strode out across the concourse flagstones. from the attentive ranks of the honour guard, milo sighed. he was relieved to see that gaunt was clean and shaved. gaunt's silvertrimmed black leather uniform was immaculate. perhaps the unpleasant incident in the universitariat had been just an aberration� gaunt saluted the lord general and introduced his fellow officers. the band played on. she nodded. her face was lean and pinched and her greying hair was cropped. oh yes. blamire fixed him with a craggy gaze, a patient smile on her lips. the party of officers stood on the flat roof of the treasury, escorted by over fifty guardsmen. prayer kites and votive flags cracked and shimmied in the air above them. gaunt asked. there was a long silence broken only by the whip and buffet of the flags and kites above them. what is the scale of the enemy response? that is not an option. i have communicated the situation to the warmaster, and he has confirmed my fears. the recon-quest of the cabal system is now fully underway. the warmaster has committed all the crusade legions to the assault. many are already en route to the fortress-worlds. quietly, the assembled officers made it clear they did. gaunt replied stiffly, taking a sip of wine. his own dish of gleaming black shellfish lay largely untouched before him. lugo looked up from his meal at gaunt and finished chewing the nugget of succulent white meat in his mouth before replying. he dabbed his lips with the corner of his napkin. hark shrugged wordlessly. quite so. all of the ayatani, and all the precious relics of this world. most precious of all are the remains of the saint herself, interred at the shrinehold in the mountains. gaunt nodded slowly. he realised he had no choice anyway. your command status has always been thought of as strange, gaunt. a colonel is a colonel and a commissar is a commissar. many have wondered how you could perform both those duties effectively when the primary rationale of a commissar is to keep a check on the unit's commander. for a while. crusade command has been considering appointing a commissar to the tanith first to operate in conjunction with you. lugo asked with a wry smile. � saint sabbat, epistles the honour guard left the doctrinopolis the next morning at daybreak, crossing the holy river and travelling west out of the pilgrim gate onto the wide track of the tembarong road. the convoy was almost three kilometres long from nose to tail: the entire ghost regiment, carried in a line of fiftyeight long-body trucks: twenty pardus mainline battle tanks, fifteen munition chimeras and four hydra tractors, two trojans, eight scout salamanders and three salamander command variants. their dust plume could be seen for miles and the throaty rumble of their collective turbines rolled around the shallow hills of the rainwoods. a handful of motorcycle outriders buzzed around their skirts, and in their midst travelled eight supply trucks laden with provisions and spares and two heavy fuel tankers. the tankers would get them to bhavnager, two or three days away, where local fuel supplies would replenish them. gaunt rode in one of the command salamanders near the head of the column. he had specifically chosen a vehicle away from hark, who travelled with the pardus commander, kleopas, in his command vehicle, one of the pardus regiment's conqueror-pattern battle tanks. gaunt stood up in the light tank's open body and steadied himself on the armour cowling against the lurching it made. the air was warm and sweet, though tinged with exhaust fumes. he had twenty-five hundred infantry in his retinue, and the force of a mid-strength armour brigade. if this was his last chance to experience command, it was at least a good one. his head ached. the previous night he'd retired alone to his chambers in the universitariat and drunk himself to sleep over a stack of route maps. gaunt looked up into the blue as invisible shapes shrieked over, leaving contrails behind them that slowly dissipated. for the first hour or two, they'd have air cover from the navy's lightnings. he looked back, down the length of the massive vehicle column. through the dust wake, he could see the doctrinopolis falling away behind them, a dimple of buildings rising up beyond the woodlands, hazed by the distance. the flickering light storm of the citadel was still visible. he'd left many valuable men back there. the ghosts wounded in the city fight, corbec among them. the wounded were due to be evacuated out in the next few days as part of the abandonment program. he was going to miss corbec. he was sadly struck by the notion that his last mission with the ghosts would be conducted without the aid of the bearded giant. and he wondered what would happen to the ghosts after his removal. he couldn't imagine them operating under a commander brought in from outside, and there was no way corbec or rawne would be promoted. the likelihood was the tanith first would simply cease to be once he had gone. there was no prospect for renewal. the troopers would be transferred away into other regiments, perhaps as recon specialists, and that would be that. his looming demise meant the demise of his beloved tanith regiment too. in one of the troop trucks, tona criid craned her head back to look at the distant city. tona sat back next to him in the bucking truckbed. tona criid said nothing. at vervunhive, thanks to circumstance, she had become the de facto mother of two orphaned children. they now accompanied the tanith first war machine as part of the sizeable and extended throng of camp followers. many of that group, the cooks and mechanics and munition crew, were travelling with them, but many had been left behind for the evacuation. children, wives, whores, musicians, entertainers, tailors, peddlers, panders. there was no place for them on this stripped-down mission. they would leave hagia on the transports and, god-emperor willing, would be reunited with their friends, and comrades and clients in the first later. tona took out the double-faced pendant she wore around her neck and looked wistfully at the faces of her children, preserved in holoportraits and set in plastic. yoncy and dalin. the babe in arms and the fretful young boy. he thought of them as his too now. by extension, by the nature of the relationship he had with tona, dalin called him papa caff. they were as close to an actual family unit as it was possible to get in the imperial guard. that got a far more resounding cheer. she showed him the pendant. kolea nodded and let go of the pendant. he walked to the end of the lurching track and looked out into the rainwoods and irrigated field systems as they passed. they were his. the children in the pendant portrait were his children. children he thought long gone and dead on verghast. some god-mocking irony had let them survive and be here. here, with the ghosts. he felt sick and overjoyed all at the same time. what could he say? what could he begin to say to criid or caffran or the kids? tears welled in his eyes. he looked out at the rainwoods sliding by and said nothing because there was nothing he could say. the tembarong road ran flat, wide and straight through the arable lowlands and rainwoods west of the doctrinopolis. the lowlands were formed by the broad basin of the holy river, which irrigated the fields and ditch systems of the local farmers every year with its seasonal floods. there was a fresh, damp smell in the air and for a lot of the way, the road followed the curving river bank. sergeant mkoll ran ahead of the main convoy in one of the scout salamanders with troopers mkvenner and bonin and the driver. mkoll had used salamanders a couple of times before, but he was always impressed with the little open-topped track-machines' turn of speed. this one wore pardus armour insignia on its coat of blue-green mottle, carried additional tarp-wrapped equipment slouched like papooses to the side sponsons, and had its pair of huge uhf vox-antennas bent back over its body and tied off on the rear bars. the driver was a tall, adenoidal youth from the pardus armour aux who wore mirrored glare-goggles and drove like he wanted to impress the tanith. they dashed down the tree-lined road at close to sixty kph, waking out a fan tail of pink dust behind them off the dry earth surface. mkvenner and bonin dung on, grinning like fools and enjoying the ride. mkoll checked his map book and made notes against the edges of the glass-paper charts with a wax pencil. gaunt wanted to make the most of the tembarong road. he wanted a quick motorised dash for the first few days as far as the sound highway lasted. their speed was bound to drop once the trail entered the rainwoods, and after that, as they wound their way up into the highlands things might get very slow altogether. there was no way of telling what state the hill roads were in after the winter rains, and they were hoping to pass a great many tonnes of steel along them. as scout commander, mkoll had special responsibilities for route-tasking and performance. he'd spent a while talking to captain herodas the night before, assessing the mean road and off-road speeds the pardus could manage. he'd also spoken to intendant elthan, who ran the munitorium's freight motorpool. he and his drivers were crewing the troop trucks and tankers. mkoll had taken their conservative estimates of speed and mileage and revised them down. both herodas and elthan were imagining a trip of five or six days to travel the three hundred or so kilometres to the shrine-hold, roads permitting. mkoll was looking at seven at least, maybe eight. and if it was eight, they'd have barely a day to collect up what they'd come for and turn around for the home run, or they'd miss lord general lugo's eighteen-day evacuation deadline. for now, the going was clear. the sky was still violet blue, and a combination of low altitude and the trees kept the breezes down. it was hot. at first they passed few people on the road except the occasional farmer, or a family group, and once or twice a drover with a small train of livestock. the farmfolk had tried to maintain cultivation during the infardi occupation, but they had suffered, and mkoll saw that great areas of the field-stocks and water beds were neglected and overgrown. the few locals they saw turned to watch them pass and raised a hand of greeting or gratitude. there was no sign of infardi, many of whom had apparently fled out this way. the road and its environs showed some sign of shelling and air damage, but it was old. the war had passed over this area briefly months ago, but most of the conflict on hagia had been focused on the dries. every once in a while, their passing engines scared flocks of gaudy-feathered fliers up out of trees and roosts. the trees were lush green and roped with epiphytes, their trunks tall, curved and ridged. to mkoll, raised in the towering, temperate nalwood forests of tanith, they seemed slight and decorative, like ornamental shrubs, despite the fact that some of them were in excess of twenty metres tall. at regular intervals through the trees, they caught racing glimpses of the sunlight on the river. along one half kilometre stretch where the highway ran right beside the water's edge, they motored past a line of fishermen wading out into the river stream, casting hand nets. the fishers all wore sun-hats woven from the local vindeaves. the river dictated the way of life in the floodplains. the few roadside dwellings and small settlements they went through were built up on wood-post stilts against the seasonal water rise. they also passed ornately carved and brightly painted boxes raised three metres high on intricately carved single posts. these were occasional things, appearing singly by the roadside or in small groups in glades set from the highway. in the hour before noon, they ran through an abandoned village of overgrown, unkept stilt houses and came around one of the road's sharper bends, almost head-first into a herd of chelons and their drovers. the pardus driver gave out a little gasp, and hauled on the steering yoke, pulling the salamander half up onto the bushy verge, into the foliage and to an undignified halt. unconcerned, the chelons, more than forty of them, lowed and grunted as they shambled past. they were the biggest mkoll had yet seen on hagia, the great bell-domed shells of the largest and most mature towering above their vehicle. the smallest and youngest had blue-black skins that gleamed like oil and a fibrous dark patina to their shells, while the elders' hides were paler and less lustrous, lined with cracks and wrinkles, their massive shells limed almost white. a haze of dry, earthy animal smells wafted from them: dung, fodder, saliva in huge quantities. the three drovers ran over to the salamander the moment it came to rest, waving their jiddi-sticks and exclaiming in alarm. all three were tired, hungry men in the earth-tone robes of the agricultural caste. mkoll jumped down from the back step and raised his arms to calm their jabberings while mkvenner directed the pardus driver as he reversed the light tank back out of the thorn breaks. mkoll pulled out his mapbook and showed the route to the men, who passed it between themselves, contradicting each other's remarks. his ancient weather-beaten skin was as lined and gnarled as that of the chelons he drove. lots of livestock and three harmless herdsmen. they may be off road by the time you reach them, but be warned. the driver throttled the salamander's turbine and pointed her nose up the brown mud-cake of the highway. a good fifteen kilometres back down the tembarong road, the honour guard convoy slowed and came to a halt. the big khaki troop trucks bunched up, nose to nose and shuddered their exhaust stacks impatiently as they revved. a few sounded their horns. the sun was high overhead and gleamed blindingly off the metalwork. to the left of the convoy, the blue waters of the holy river crept by on the other side of a low levee. rawne got up in the back of his transport and climbed up on the guardrail so he could look out along the length of the motorcade over the track's cab. all he could see was stationary armour and laden tracks right down to the bend in the road three hundred metres away. feygor nodded and relayed the glib order to the fifty or so men in the transport cargo area. there was a lot of vox traffic. questioning calls were running up and down the convoy. soric asked, jerking a thumb at the unmoving convoy. rawne didn't warm to people much, but he liked the old man. rawne nodded. the sergeant gently windmilled his arm, nursing the cybernetic shoulder joint the augmeticists had given him on fortis binary several years before. then he glanced quickly at rawne. privately, rawne was enjoying his new-found seniority. with both corbec and that upstart captain daur out of the picture, he was now the acting second of the regiment, with only the pardus major kleopas and the outsider commissar hark near to him in the taskforce pecking order. mkoll was the ghosts' number three officer for the duration, and kolea had been given daur's verghastite liaison tasks. what irked him more was the notion that baffels was right. corbec should be here. it went against rawne's impulse, because he'd never liked corbec that much either, but it was true. he felt it in his blood. what everyone knew and none wanted to talk about was that this seemed likely to be the last mission of the tanith first the lord general had broken gaunt, and rawne would lead the applause when they came to march gaunt away in disgrace, but still� this was the ghosts' final show. and, feth him, corbec should be here. mad larkin sat, hot and edgy, in the rear of a vacated truck, his long-pattern las resting on the bodywork. kolea had left him and cuu on point while the others ran to the river to cool down and blow off steam. larkin searched the far side of the road with his usual obsessive methods, sectioning the tree-line and the expanse of water-field by eye and then scanning each section in turn sequentially.thorough, careful, faultless. each movement made him tense, but each movement turned out to be flapping forkbills or scampering spider-rats or even just the breeze-sway of the fronded leaves. he passed the time with target practice, searching out a target and then following it through his scope's crosshairs. the red-crested forkbills were fine enough, but they were an easy target because of their white plumage and size. the spider-rats were better creepy eight-limbed mammals the size of larkin's hand that jinked up and down the tree trunks in skittering stop -start trajectories so fast they made a sport out of it. cuu put one away and lit the other, drawing deep. larkin could smell the scent of obscura. he'd used it occasionally back on tanith, but it was one of gaunt's banned substances. cuu grinned and exhaled ostentatiously. bulk up standard rations, a few of them. three, this is larks. cuu and i are going off the track to nab a few waterbirds for eating. cuu nodded. cuu held his hand out and larkin reluctantly handed the long-las to him, taking cuu's standard lasrifle in return. nice as nice. larkin wanted to complain, but cuu swung the long-las round quick fare and destroyed two more birds. the water under the trees was thick with blood stains and floating white feathers. cuu shook his head, and aimed again. he'd switched the long-las to rapid fire and when he pulled the trigger, pulse after pulse whined into the canopy. larkin was alarmed. alarmed at the misuse of his beloved weapon, alarmed at cuu's psychopathic glee� �and most of all, alarmed at the way cuu's wildfire blasted and crisped a half dozen spider-rats off the surrounding tree trunks. not a shot was wasted or went wide. skittering targets even he'd have to think twice about hitting were reduced to seared, blood-leaking impacts on the trees. larkin hurried after him. he shivered despite the sun's heat that baked down over the highway. cold killer. larkin knew he'd be watching his back from now on. at the front end of the immobile convoy, gaunt, kleopas and herodas stood watching the tech-priests and engineers of the pardus regiment as they struggled to retrack the defective chimera. a workteam of pardus and tanith personnel had already unloaded the armoured transport by hand to reduce its payload weight. the trojan throbbed and idled nearby like a watchful parent. captain herodas moved away to shout encouraging orders at the engineer teams. gaunt pulled out a silver hip flask. he offered it to kleopas. do the squad leaders know? hark made an open-handed shrug. trust me. alpha-ar pulled into mukret in the late afternoon. the salamander rolled down to a crawl and mkoll, mkvenner and bonin leapt out, lasguns raised, trailing the light tank down the main highway as it passed through the jumble of stilt houses and raised halls. a slight breeze had picked up with the approach of evening, and it lifted dust and leaflitter across the bright sunlit road and the dark spaces of shadow between and under the dwellings. the sun itself, big and yellowing, shone sideways through a stiff break of palms and cypresses towards the river. the township was deserted. doors flapped open and epiphytic creepers roiled around window frames and stack posts. there was broken crockery on the house-walks, and litters of ragged clothing in the gutters. at the far end of the town sat long, brick and tile smokehouses. mukret's main industry was the smoke-drying of fish and meats. the tanith could still pick out the tangy background scent of woodsmoke in the air. behind the rolling tank, the three scouts prowled forward, lasguns held in loose, fluid grips. bonin swung and aimed abruptly as forkbills mobbed out of a tree. the salamander rumbled. mkoll moved ahead and switched bonin left down a jetty walk to the river itself with a coded gesture. ahead, something stirred. it was a chelon, an immature calf, wandering out into the main road, dragging its reins in the dust. a short-form clutch saddle was lashed to its back. it wandered past mkoll and mkvenner, trailing its bridle. mkoll could hear sporadic knocking now. mkoll signalled for mkvenner to hold back as cover and walked forward towards the noise. an old man, skinny and gnarled, was hammering panels into place on an old and ransacked stilt-chapel. it looked like he was trying to board up broken windows using only a length of tree-limb as a hammer. he was dressed in blue silk robes. ayatani , mkoll realised. the old man turned and lowered his tree-limb. he was bald, but had a triumphantly long, tapering white beard. the old man clambered back down to the roadway and faced mkoll. really? well now� i won't let them have it! i won't! zweil suddenly took mkoll by the arm and pointed him west, over the roofscape of mukret, towards the distant edges of the rainwoods, which were becoming hazed and misty in the late afternoon. a dark stain of stormclouds was gathering over the neighbouring hills. twenty kilometres east, the main convoy was moving again. the munitions chimera had been repaired well enough for the time being, though intendant elthan had warned gaunt it would need a proper overhaul during the night rest. they were making good time again. gaunt sat in the open cab of his command salamander, reviewing the charts and hoping they'd make it to mukret before nightfall. mkoll had just checked in. alpha-ar had reached mukret and found it deserted, though the dour scout had repeated his warning about infardi sightings. gaunt put the maps aside and turned to his battered, annotated copy of saint sabbat's gospel, as he had done many times that day. trying to read the text in the jolting salamander made his head hurt, but he persisted. he flicked through to the most recent of the paper place-markers he'd left. the mid-section, the psalms of sabbat. virtually impenetrable, their language both antique and mysteriously coded with symbols. he could read everything and nothing into them as meaning, but nothing was all he took away. except that it was the most beautiful religious verse he'd ever read. warmaster slaydo had thought so too. it was from him that gaunt had got his love of the sabbat psalms. his hands lowered the book to his knees as he looked up and remembered slaydo for a moment. he felt a lurch as the tank slowed suddenly, and stood up to look. his mount was third from the front of the convoy, and the two scout salamanders ahead had dropped speed sharply. red brake lights came on behind their metal grilles, stark and bright in the twilight. a large herd of massive chelons was coming towards them, driven by several beige-robed peasants. it was half blocking the road. the convoy leaders were being forced to pull into tight single file against the riverwards edge of the highway. mkoll had warned him about this. lots of livestock and three harmless herdsmen, he'd said, though he'd seemed certain they'd be off the road before the convoy met them. drop your speed and pull over to the extreme left. we've got livestock on the road. the drivers and crews snapped back responses over the link. the convoy slowed to a crawl and began to creep along past the straggled line of lowing, shambling beasts. gaunt cursed this fresh delay. it would be a good ten minutes until they were clear of the obstruction. he looked out at the big shell-backs as they went by close enough to lean out and touch. their animal odour was strong and earthy, and gaunt could hear the creak of their leathery armour skin and the gurgle of their multichambered stomachs. they broke noxious wind, or groaned and snuffled. blunt muzzles chewed regurgitated cuds. he saw the drovers too. large labourers in the coarse off-white robes of the agrarian caste, urging the beasts on with taps of their jiddi-sticks, their hoods and face-veils pulled up against the dust. a few nodded apologetically to him as they passed. most didn't spare the imperials a look. religious war and sacred desecration ravages their world and for them, it's business as usual, thought gaunt. some lives in this lethal galaxy were enviably simple� lots of livestock and three harmless herdsmen. he remembered mkoll's report with abrupt clarity. three harmless herdsmen. two vehicles back, a command salamander slewed wildly and vomited a fierce cone of flame and debris out of its crew-space. metal fragments rained down out of the air, tinking off his own vehicle's bodywork. the vox-link went mad. gaunt could hear sustained bursts of las-fire and auto weapons. herdsmen, suddenly several dozen in number, were surging out from the cover of their agitated animals. they had weapons. as their robes fell away, he saw body art and green silk. he grabbed his bolt pistol. the infardi were all over them. � imperial guard song his drover's disguise flapping about him, an infardi gunman clambered up the mudguard of the command salamander and raised his autopistol, a yowl of rabid triumph issuing from his scabby lips. he stank of fermented fruit liquor and his eyes were wild-white with intoxicated frenzy. gaunt's bolt round hit him point-blank in the right cheek and disintegrated his head in a puff of liquidised tissue. gaunt could hear further missile impacts and lots of small arms lire.  the chelons, viced in by the road edge on one side and the imperial armour on the other, were whinnying with agitation and banging the edges of their shells up against vehicle hulls. the pardus replied desperately. gaunt bellowed. he rose in the back of the tank and fired into the charging enemy, killing one infardi and crippling a mature chelon. the beast shrieked and slumped over, crushing two more of the ambushers before rolling hard into the chimera behind. it began to writhe, baying, shoving the tank into the verge. gaunt swore and grabbed the firing grips of the pintle-mounted storm bolter. infardi were appearing in the road ahead and he raked the hardpan, dropping several. some had swarmed over the leading scout tank ahead and were murdering the crew. the vehicle slewed to a drunken, sidelong halt. a tank round roared off close behind him. he heard the hot detonation of superheating gas, the grinding clank of the recoiling weapon, the whoosh of the shell. it fell in the ditchfield to the right of the road and kicked up a huge spout of liquid muck. more tanks now fired their main guns, and turret-mounted bolters chattered and sprayed. another big chelon, hit dead centre by a tank shell, exploded wholesale and a big, stinking cloud of blood mist and intestinal gas billowed down the convoy. gaunt knew they had the upper hand in terms of strength, but the ambushers had been canny. they'd slowed the convoy down with the livestock and pinned it against the road wall so it couldn't manoeuvre. he fired the weapon mount again, chopping through an infardi running up to position a missile launcher. dead fingers convulsed anyway and the missile fired and immediately dropped, blowing a deep crater in the road. something grabbed gaunt from behind and pulled him off the storm bolter. he fell back into the tank's crewbay, kicking and fighting for his life. the first third of the honour guard convoy was under hard assault, jammed and slowed to such an extent by the herd that the trailing portion of the convoy, straggled back to a more than four kilometre spread now, couldn't move up to successfully support. larkin found himself next to cuu, firing down from their troop truck body into the weeds as infardi swarmed up out of the waterline, shooting as they came. cuu was giggling gleefully as he killed. sergeant kolea yelled, and the tanith leapt from the trucks en masse, charging the attackers with fixed bayonets and blazing las-fire. criid and caffran charged together, hitting the first of the infardi hand to hand, clubbing and gutting them. caffran dropped for a wide shot that sent another ambusher tumbling back down the ditch into the field. criid fell, got up, and laced las-blasts into the shins of the infardi stampeding towards them. a pardus tank roared nearby, blindly shelling the herd. rawne's track, further down the line, was mobbed by infardi. the cargo bed rocked as bodies piled onto it. rawne fired his lasgun into the thick press, and saw feygor rip an enemy's throat out with his silver tanith knife. the darkening evening air was crisscrossed by painfully bright las-fire. a second later, gusting flames surged down the roadside gulley. from varl's track, trooper brostin was washing the roadline with bursts from his flamer. major kleopas tried to turn his conqueror, but a massive chelon, bucking and hooting, slammed into his bull-bars and shunted the entire tank around. for a full five seconds, the tank's racing tracks dragged at thin air as the weight of the bull chelon drove its nose into the road. then the tracks grabbed purchase again. kleopas' tank lurched forward. kleopas barked down at his driver. the conqueror battle tank, named heart of destruction according to the hand-painted hull logo, scrambled sideways in a vast spray of dust and then drove its bulldozer blade into the legs of the big bull chelon. kleopas' tank maimed the animal and rammed it off the highway, though the conqueror dented its hull plating against the chelon's shell in the process. squealing, the chelon fell down into the waterfield ditch and rolled over on its back, squashing eight infardi troopers in the irrigation gulley. the heart of destruction dipped off the roadside and down into the waterbed, tracks churning. as his main gunner and gun layer pumped shells into the breaks of trees beyond the road, kleopas manned the bolter hardpoint and blasted tracer shots across the irrigation ditches. his manoeuvre began to break the deadlock. three tanks followed him through the gap he'd cut and rattled round into the tree-line off the road, wasting the dug-in infardi with turret bolters and flamers. in the closed track carrying the medical supplies, ana curth flinched as stray shots punched through the hardskin and her racks of bottled pharmaceuticals. glass debris spat in all directions. lesp stumbled to his knees, a dark line of blood welling across his cheek from a sliver of flying glass. two infardi clambered up the rear gate of the track. curth kicked one away with a boot in the face, and then dragged out a laspistol soric had given her and fired twice. the second infardi attacker fell off the track. curth turned to see if lesp was all right. she saw the alarm in his face, half-heard the warning shout coming from his mouth, and then felt herself grabbed and pulled bodily out of the track. her world spun. terror viced her. she was jerked upside down, held carelessly by the legs, her face in the dirt. the infardi were all over her, clawing and tearing. she could smell their wretched sweat-stink. all she could see was a jumble of green silk and tattooed flesh. there was a sudden glare of hard blue light and a sizzling sound. hot liquid sprayed over her, and she realised, with professional detachment, that it was blood. she swung as the grip on her half-released. the blur of blue light carved the air again and something yelped. she collapsed onto the road, flat on her belly, and rolled up in time to see ibram gaunt raking his glowing power sword around in an expert figure-six swing that felled an infardi like a tree. gaunt had lost his cap and his clothes were torn. there was an unnerving look of unquenchable fury in his eyes. he wielded the sacred blade of her home-hive two-handed now, like a champion of antique myth. dismembered bodies piled around him and the gritty sand of the road was soaked with gore for metres in every direction. a hero, she thought abruptly, realising it truly in her mind for the first time. damn lugo and his disdain! this man is an imperial hero! lesp, his face running with blood, appeared suddenly behind the commissar in the back gatehatch of the medical truck and began laying down support fire with his lasgun. gaunt staked his power sword tip-down in the road and knelt next to it, scooping up a fallen infardi lasrifle. his short, clipped bursts of fire joined lesp's, stinging across the road and into the mob of infardi. green-clad bodies tumbled onto the road or slithered back down the trench into the field. curth scrambled over to gaunt on her hands and knees.  once she was safely beside him, she too knelt and began firing with a purloined infardi weapon. she had none of the commissar's trained skill with an assault las, nor as much as trooper lesp, but she made a good account of herself with the unfamiliar weapon nevertheless. gaunt, grim and driven, handled his firing pattern with an assured expertise that would have shamed even a well-drilled infantryman. never give the enemy anything, ana. sensing that, she felt surprised too. at herself, for her own stupidity. it was obvious and she'd known it all along if she'd but recognised it. that was gaunt's way. gaunt the imperial hero. give nothing. never. ever. never let your guard down, never allow the enemy the slightest edge. stay firm and die hard. nothing else would do. it wasn't just the commissar in him. it was the warrior, curth realised. it was gaunt's fundamental philosophy. it had brought him here and would carry him on to whatever death, kind or cruel, the fates had in store for him. it made him what he was: the relentless soldier, the celebrated leader, the terrifying slayer. she felt unbearably sad for him and in awe of him all in the same moment. ana curth had heard about the disgrace awaiting gaunt at the end of this mission. that made her saddest of all. she realised he was going to be absolutely true to his duty and his calling right to the end, no matter the shadow of dishonour hanging over him. he would not falter. gaunt would be gaunt until death claimed him. fifty metres away, captain herodas fell out of a burning salamander a few moments before a second anti-tank rocket whooshed out of the roadside trees and blew it apart. almost immediately, a hard-slug tore through his left knee and threw him into the dust. he blacked out in pain for a second and then fought back, trying to crawl. the pardus trooper next to him was face down in a pool of blood. herodas tried to rum the man over, but the limbs were loose and the body was hollow and empty. herodas looked down and saw the horror of blown-out meat and bone shards that was all that remained of his own leg joint. lasshots zinged over his head. he reached for his pistol but his holster was flapping open. there were tears in his eyes. the dull pain was rising to overwhelm him. from all around came the sounds of screaming, shooting, killing. the ground shook. herodas looked up in disbelief at the cow chelon that was stampeding towards him from the trapped, terrified herd. it was a third the size of the big bulls, but still weighed in at over two tonnes. he closed his eyes tight and braced for the bone-splintering impact that was about to come. a thin beam of hot red energy stabbed across the road and hit the hurtling brute with such force it was blown sideways off its feet. the shot disintegrated a huge hole in the chelon and left it a smouldering husk, dripping fatty mush. plasma fire! thought herodas. thrice-damned gods! that was plasma fire! he saw the stocky shape of commissar hark striding down the roadway, dark in the rising dust and evening light, his long coat rippling around him. hark was calling out commands and pointing as he directed the units of sprinting tanith infantry down the road and into the enemy flank. he held an ancient plasma pistol in his right hand. hark halted and sent three more troop units on past him as they ran up, forking them wide to disperse them into the roadside gutter. he turned and waved two pardus conquerors forward off the road with quick, confident gestures. then he spun round abruptly, brought up his weapon, and cremated an infardi who had risen from the roadside weeds with a rifle. hark crossed to herodas. herodas complained. hark smiled. elthan hissed, his lips tight around his yellowed teeth. elthan relied.  fortis binary. vervunhive. monthax. sapiencia. nacedon. elthan went a little red around the edges and then blustered on. asked elthan. because you are not a soldier, intendant. elthan turned disdainfully and stalked away. down the road, a trio of pardus tanks had lowered their dozer blades and were ploughing the chelon carcasses off the thoroughfare. hark asked gaunt. gaunt nodded with an unfriendly smile. but it can only get worse from here. spearhead, from mukret, at dawn. mkoll nodded. baffels nodded. gaunt walked through the busy activity of the convoy, away, down to the river's edge, where the rippling water reflected back the moons and the chirrup of night insects filled every angle of the darkness. milo. gaunt had always joked about the way the men saw brin milo as his lucky charm. he'd teased them for their superstitious foolishness. but in his heart, silently, he'd always felt that it was actually true. milo had a charmed life. he had the pure flavour of lost tanith about him. he was their last and only link to the ghosts' past. gaunt had always kept him close for that reason, though he'd never, ever admitted it. hark had chosen milo to be the one to return to the holy city. accident? coincidence? design? hark had already stated he had studied the tanith records. he had to know how psychologically important brin was to the ghosts. to gaunt. gaunt had a nasty feeling he'd been deliberately undermined. worse still, he had a feeling of doom. for the first time, they were going out without milo. he already knew this mission was going to be his last. now, with a sense of terrifying premonition, he felt it was going to rum bad. very bad indeed. far away now, chasing back down the tembarong road towards the doctrinopolis, the lone troop track thundered through the night. milo had ridden in the cab for the first part of the overnight journey, but the obese munitorium driver had proved to be surly and taciturn, and then had begun to exhibit a chronic flatulence problem that would have been offensive even in an open-topped car. milo had climbed back to spend the rest of the trip with the wounded men. commissar hark had singled him out for this duty. milo wondered why. there were any number of troopers who could have done the job. milo wondered if hark had chosen him because he hadn't been a proper trooper long. despite his uniform, some of the ghosts still regarded him as the token civilian. he resented that. he was a fething imperial guardsman and he'd take physical issue with anyone who doubted that even more, he resented missing out on what he knew would be the last action of the tanith ghosts under ibram gaunt he doubted there would be much glory in the mission, but still he yearned to be there. he felt cheated. then, as he watched the moons' light flickering on the river dashing by, he wondered if gaunt had told hark to select him. his encounter with gaunt in the universitariat still stung. had gaunt really wished him away? most of the wounded were unconscious or asleep. milo sat beside captain herodas in the back of the rocking track. the captain was pale from blood loss and trauma and his face was pinched. milo was afraid herodas wasn't going to make it back to the doctrinopolis, despite medic curth's ministrations. he'd lost so much blood. milo wanted to keep him talking. about anything, any old nonsense. he was worried what might happen if herodas fell asleep. herodas chuckled. milo grimaced. a fine commander. herodas coughed and smiled. glory like milo rose up in the flatbed of the bouncing truck and looked out through the windy dark at the lambent flames burning distantly on the citadel. they made a beacon in the night. sir? what did you say? sir? my name is lucan herodas. i don't feel like being a �sir' anymore. herodas nodded slowly. lucan herodas didn't reply. the truck rolled in under the pilgrim gate. dawn was just a suggestion at the horizon. ten minutes later, the truck drew up in the yard of the western city infirmary. by then, herodas was dead. � early daylight poured in like milk through the west facing casement. the air was cool with the promise of a hot day ahead. a smell of antiseptic wafted in from the hospital halls. dorden asked conversationally, moving towards the cabinet beside the gauze-veiled bed. he hoped the sound of his voice would slowly, gently rouse the colonel so he could check him over. more than one orderly had received a slap in the mouth for waking corbec too abruptly. too many dreams. i'm dreaming about my son a lot these days. mikal, you know. he comes to me in my dreams all the time. i haven't worked out what he's trying to tell me, but he's trying to tell me something. the voices dropped away and he turned back to face the veiled bed. it's no joke, corbec. these are powerful drags. � but this is our heritage! daur had heard the same sentiments expressed several times in the last day or so. despite the abominable evil that moved towards them with the clear intent to engulf the entire world, few native hagians wanted the evacuation. many of the ayatani, in fact, saw the removal of icons and relics for safekeeping tantamount to desecration. but lord general lugo's decrees had been strict and inflexible. daur wondered how long it would be before a hagian was arrested for obstruction or shot for disobedience. he felt an immeasurable sympathy for the faithful. it was almost as if his wounding had been an epiphany. he'd always been a dutiful man, dutiful to the imperial creed, a servant of the god-emperor. but he'd never thought of himself as especially� devout. until now. until here on hagia. until, it seemed to ban daur, the very moment an infardi dagger had punched between his ribs. it was like it had changed him, as if he'd been transformed by sharp steel and his own spilt blood. he heard about men undergoing religious transformations. it scared him. it was in his head and it wouldn't leave him alone. he felt he needed to do something about it, desperately. limping his way from the infirmary to the nearest temple was a start, but it didn't seem to achieve much. daur didn't know what he expected to happen. a sign, perhaps. a message. such a thing didn't seem very likely. he sighed, and sat back with his eyes closed for a moment. he was scheduled to join a troop ship with the other walking wounded at six that evening. he wasn't looking forward to it. it felt like running away. when he opened his eyes, he saw a familiar figure amongst the faithful at the foot of the main altar. it was such a surprise, daur blinked in confusion. but he was not mistaken. there was colm corbec, his left arm webbed in a sling tight against his bandaged chest, the sleeve of his black fatigue jacket hanging empty, kneeling in prayer. daur waited. after a few minutes, corbec stood up, turned, and saw daur sitting in the pews. a look of puzzlement crossed the grizzled giant's face. he came over at once. corbec asked. they sat in silence for a while. the basilica choir began to sing, the massed voices shimmering the air. daur whispered softly. corbec dabbed his bread into the broth distractedly. he smiled, turning as he was released. bragg glanced contemptuously at his heavily bandaged right shoulder. milo pushed on through the hectic hallway through the smells of blood and disinfectant the hurrying figures, the rattling carts. he passed several doors that opened onto long, red-painted wards lined with critically injured guardsmen in rows of cots. some were ghosts, men he recognised. all were too far gone from pain and damage to register him. after asking questions of several orderlies and servitors, he found his way to dorden's suite of offices on the third floor. an answering mumble. dorden asked softly. his anger seemed to have dulled. dorden roared. dorden was livid. you've persuaded some other fools to go along with you? who? who, colonel? milo was afraid he was going to throw a punch. pulling at me, demanding of me! dorden snorted. dorden sat down behind his desk and fiddled with a sheaf of scripts, not making eye contact with either of the others. all he says is the same thing, over and over. he's in his machine shop, back in pryze county, working the lathe there. i come in and he looks up and he says �sabbat martyr'. corbec half-shrugged. milo said nothing. he didn't know. i hope by then me dad will have told me more! or maybe daur will have figured it out. or it'll be obvious corbec turned and smiled at milo. he was so touched by the sight before him, he felt he might cry. derin! there was no sign of injury about him, but his arms moved stiffly. trooper milo described your mission as almost spiritual, colonel. i will probably lose my privileges and status for absconding with you. the troopers around them laughed. sanian smiled. he was a tall, blond, freckled individual in pardus uniform. his head was bandaged. corbec asked him. the same action daur had been hurt in. at around half past six the names of troopers derin, vamberfeld, nessa and bragg, and of captain daur and colonel corbec, were noted in the log of the evacuation office as overdue. the lift shuttle left without them. at a muster point further east across the doctrinopolis, the pardus chief surgeon noted the absence of driver- sergeant greer. both reports were sent to evacuation command and entered into the night log. the officer of the watch wasn't unduly taxed by this. he had over three hundred names on his list of absentees by then, and it was growing with each passing shuttle call. there were many reasons for missed muster: badly relayed orders; confusion as to the correct muster point; delays because of traffic in the holy city; untagged deaths from the guard infirmaries. indeed, some names on the evacuation lists were of troopers who had died in the liberation fight and as yet lay undiscovered and unidentified in the rubble. some, a very few, were deserters. such names were passed to the discipline offices and the lord general's staff. the officer of the watch passed these latest names on. it was unusual for senior officers like a colonel to fail to report. by eight o'clock, the list had dropped onto the desk of commissar hychas, who was away at dinner. his aide passed it to the punishment detail, who by nine thirty had sent a four-man team led by a commissar-cadet down to the scholam medicae hagias to investigate. a report was copied to lord general lugo's staff, where it was read by a senior adjutant shortly before midnight. he immediately voxed the punishment detail, and was told by the commissar-cadet that no trace of the missing personnel could be found at the scholam medicae. at one in the morning, a warrant was issued for the arrest of colonel colm corbec of the tanith first-and-only, along with six of his men. no one thought or knew to tally this with the warrant out for sergeant-driver denic greer of the pardus eighth. or the theft report of a class gamma transport chimera from the munitorium motorpool. by then, corbec's chimera was long gone, heading west down the tembarong road, five hours out from the city perimeter, thundering into the night. it had made one stop, in the half-empty, wartorn suburb streets just short of the pilgrim gate. that had been around seven at night, with deep, starless dusk falling. at the helm, greer had seen a figure in the road ahead, waving at them. corbec had popped the turret hatch and looked out, almost immediately calling down at greer to pull over. gaunt asked him as the convoy ran through the pale, smoke-like mists. it was bright and the fogs glowed with the sunlight beyond, but they could see only a few dozen metres ahead of themselves.  the sounds of the convoy engines, amplified, were thrown back on them by the heavy vapour. zweil chuckled. they pace out the route of her great crusade, her war pilgrimage to harkalon, her wide circuit of return. it can take a lifetime, longer than a lifetime. the main purpose of the imhava ayatani is to retread the routes of the saint and offer assistance to the believers and pilgrims we find making their way. guardians of the route. it is, i think, small-minded for a priest to stay at a shrine or temple to offer aid to the pilgrims who arrive. the journey is the hardest part. with devotion and resolve, you are following one of the saint's paths. but pilgrims usually travel east. oh, but i'm sure you did. and from that i'm sure you can tell me that when the saint talks of the �flower incarnadine' she means battle, and when she refers to �the fast-flowing river of pure water' she means true human faith. what i mean to say is the lessons of saint sabbat are oblique mysteries, to be unlocked by experience and innate belief. i'm not sure you have those. half an hour later, they reached the crossing at nusera. the highway came down to a wide, shallow pan of shingle that broke the fast flowing water in a broad fording place. groves of ghylum trees clustered at either bank, and hundreds of forkbills broke upwards into the sky in an explosive fan at the sound of the motors, their wings beating the air with the sound of ornithopter gunships. a lone peasant with an ancient cow chelon on a pull-rein waved them past. one by one, the vehicles of the honour guard ploughed over the ford, spraying up water so hard and high that rainbows marked their wake. limata was another dead town. mkoll's spearhead reached it just before eleven thirty. the fogs had vanished. the sun was climbing and the air was still. this day was going to be even hotter than the last. the baking roofs of limata lay ahead, dusty and forlorn, their tiles bright pink in the sunlight. no breeze, no sounds, no telltale fingers of cookfire smoke rising above the village. here, the tembarong road divided, one spur heading southwest towards hylophon and tembarong itself. the other broke north-west into the highlands and the steaming tracts of the rainwoods. forty-plus kilometres in that direction lay bhavnager. troopers arm. load main weapons. sirus asked briefly. mkoll, who was generally inexperienced when it came to tank warfare, had already noted the clear differences between the conqueror battle tanks and the low-bodied destroyers. where the conquerors were high and proud, stately almost, with their massive gun turrets, the destroyers were long-hulled and sleek, their one primary weapon not turret-mounted but fixed out forward from their humped backs. the destroyers were predators, tank hunters, armed with a single, colossal laser cannon. they were, it seemed to mkoll, the tank equivalent of an infantry sniper. accurate, cunning, hard-hitting, stealthy. the destroyer appointed to the recon spear was called the grey venger. its commander was a captain leguin. mkoll had never seen leguin face to face. he just knew him by his tank. through the rising pall of smoke, mkoll saw the conquerors were in the village now. they were kicking up dust. abrupt small arms fire rained against their armoured bodies from the left. the wrath of pardua traversed its turret and blew a house apart with a single shell. its partner began shelling the right flank of the town's main drag. stilt houses disintegrated or combusted. the sponson-mounted flamers on both conquerors rippled through the close-packed buildings and turned them into torched ruins. captain sirus' whoops of triumph came over the vox. mkoll could see him in his turret, supporting his main weapon's blasts with rakes from the pintle mount. advancing, they found the bloody, burnt remnants of maybe three dozen infardi in the ruins sims had flattened, limata was taken. mkoll signalled the news to gaunt and advanced the spearhead, bringing his fire-teams in and reforming the force with the salamanders at the front. sirus warbled enthusiastically from his conqueror. well over a day behind them, corbec's thrown-together team rolled past the site of the ambush, skirting around the wrecks of the salamanders and the chimera that the task-force's trojans had pushed to the roadside verges. corbec called a halt. the chimera's turbine was overheating anyway, and the troopers dismounted for a rest corbec, derin and bragg wandered over to the roadside where a plot of dark earth and rows of fresh-cut stakes marked the graves of the fallen. corbec nodded. this site marked the first ghosts action that he hadn't been a part of. not properly. all the way from tanith he'd come, to be with his men. here, they'd fought and died while he had been lying in his bed miles away. his chest hurt. he swallowed a couple more pain-pills with a swig of tepid water from his flask. greer had dismounted from the chimera on the road and had yanked back its side cowlings to vent greasy black smoke. he reached in with a wrench, trying to soothe its ailing systems. milo thought he'd talk to sanian, but the esholi had wandered down to the water's edge with nessa. it looked like the verghastite girl was teaching the student the rudiments of sign language. yes, sir. i don't think we'd last long without a decent guide. corbec said you knew as much as him. that you � he had been the only ghost to escape the destruction of tanith with a blood relative alive. trooper mikal dorden. chief medic tolin dorden. but i do and what's that? it's so holy. vamberfeld asked. greer looked round at him with a cynical eyebrow cocked. the moment saint sabbat manifests here and helps me flush out the intercooler, then i'll believe. the gold ingots. greer shook his head to himself and returned to work. he didn't get these tanith, too intense for his liking. and ever since he'd arrived on hagia he'd heard men rambling on and on about faith and miracles. so, it was a shrineworld. so what? greer didn't hold with that sort of stuff much. you lived, you died, end of story. sometimes you got lucky and lived well. sometimes you got unlucky and died badly. god and saints and flicking angels and stuff was the sort of nonsense men filled their with heads with when bad luck came calling. he wiped his hands on a rag, and cinched the hose clamp tighter. this mob of losers was a crazy lot. the colonel and the doctor and that complete sad-case vamberfeld were mooning on about visions and saints, clearly all out of their heads. the deaf girl he didn't get. the big guy was an idiot. the boy milo was way too up himself, and only here because he had the hots for that local girl, who was incidentally a nutjob in greer's humble opinion. derin was the only one who seemed remotely okay. greer was sure that was because derin was along for the gold too. daur must have persuaded the rest of the lunatics to sign on by buying into their saint fixations. daur was a hard case. he looked all clean-cut and stalwart, the very model of a young, well-bred officer. but under the surface ticked the heart of a conniving bastard. greer knew his type. greer hadn't liked daur since the moment they'd met in the prayer yard. dressing him down in front of his men like that. greer had only ended up wounded because he'd been going balls-out in the fight to prove his mettle and win back his rep. but daur had needed a driver, and he'd cut greer in on the loot. temple gold, stacks of ingots, taken secretly from the doctrinopolis treasury to a place of hiding when the infardi invaded. that's what daur had told him. he'd got the inside track from a dying ayatani. worth deserting for in greer's book. he wouldn't be surprised if daur intended to waste the others once they were home and dry. greer would be watching his back when the time came. he'd get in first if he had to. for now though, he knew he was safe. daur needed him more than any of the others. vamberfeld was the one he worried about most. daur had recruited everyone except sanian and milo from the hospital, from amongst the injured, and they all had bandaged wounds to prove it. except vamberfeld. he was a psych case, greer knew. the timid behaviour, the thousand-metre stare. he'd seen that before in men who were on the way to snapping. war fever. greer didn't want to be around when the snap came. he closed the engine cowling. the company moved back to rejoin the chimera. for the umpteenth time that day, corbec wondered what he had got himself into. sometimes it felt so decisively right, but the rest of the time the doubts plagued him. he'd broken orders, and persuaded eight other guardsmen to do the same. and now he was heading into enemy country. he wondered what would happen if they got into a situation. milo was sound and able bodied, but the doc and sanian were non-combatants. nessa was strapped up with a healing las-wound in her belly, bragg's shoulder was useless, daur and derin had chest wounds that slowed them down badly, greer had a head-wound, and vamberfeld was teetering on the edge of nervous collapse. not to mention his own, aching wounds.  hardly the most able and fit fire-team in the history of guard actions. nor the best equipped. each trooper had a lasrifle � in nessa's case a long-las sniper model � and bragg had his big autocannon. they had a box of tubecharges but were otherwise short on ammo. as far as he knew they had only half a dozen drums for the cannon. the chimera had a storm bolter on its pintle, but given its performance so far, corbec wasn't sure how much longer it would be before they were all walking. he wondered what gaunt would do in this situation. he was pretty sure he knew. have them all shot. through the trees, thick roadside glades of acestus and slim-trunked vipirium, they began to see the outlines of bhavnager. it was late afternoon, the sun was infernally bright and hot, and the heat haze was distorting every distance. the recon spear had made excellent time, and word on the vox was that the main convoy was only seventy minutes behind them. mkoll pulled them to a halt and headed out into the groves with mkvenner to do a little scouting. they crouched in the slanting shadows of the wild fruit trees and panned their magnoculars around. the air was still and breathless, as dry and hot as baked sand. insects ticked like chronometers in the gorse thickets. mkoll compared what he saw with the town plan on his map. bhavnager was a large place, dominated by a large white-washed temple with a golden stupa to the east and a massive row of brick-built produce barns to the southwest. prayer kites and flags dangled limply from the golden dome in the breeze-less air. the road they were following entered in the south-eastern corner, ran in south of the temple to what looked like a triangular market place which roughly denoted the town centre, and then appeared again north of large buildings on the far outskirts that mkoll took to be machine shops. a streetplan of smaller roads radiated out from the market, lined with shops and dwellings. but alive this time. the pair moved forward and down a little, parallel to the highway. once the road came out of the fruit groves it was open and unprotected for over fifteen hundred metres right down to the edge of the town. trees had been felled and brush cleared. hold! mkoll yelled into the vox as his salamander lurched forward. he had to duck as debris from a perilously close shell raided across the hull. this was shelling from more than one gun. multiple points, field guns maybe, large calibre ordnance by the size of the shell strikes. where the hell were they hiding a battery of artillery? farant's conqueror suddenly came apart in a huge fireball. the explosion was so fierce the shockwave punched mkoll off his feet. splintered armour shards rained down. caober cried out as one ripped his forehead. the blazing remains of the pardus tank filled the centre of the road, turret disintegrated, bodywork fused and twisted, tread segments disengaged and scattered. sims bawled over the vox-link. mkoll saw them. two main battle tanks, painted bright lime green, main guns roaring as they tore their way out through the fruit tree stands and onto the road ahead. that was why he'd seen no artillery positions.  it wasn't artillery. the infardi had armoured vehicles. lots of them. � saint sabbat, at the gates of harkalon heedless of the 105mm shells tearing into the highway and trees around him, sims confronted the infardi armour head-on. the wrath of pardua sped forward with a clank of treads and fired its main gun. the hypervelocity round hit the nearest of the two enemy vehicles, exploding into the rear mantlet of its turret with such force the entire turret mount spun round through two hundred and ten degrees. the tank clearly retained motive power, because it continued to churn along the road, but its traverse system was crippled and the turret and weapon swung around slackly with the motion. the wrath fired again, mere seconds before a shell from the second tank glanced lengthways along its starboard flank. the hit buckled and tore its track guards and then fragmented off into the trees. the wrath's second shot had missed. the disarmed infardi machine was closing to less than forty metres now, and its hull-mounted lascannon began to spit bolts of blue light at sirus' conqueror. the other enemy tank was trying to pull around its wounded colleague for a clearer shot knocking down a row of saplings and small acestus trees as it hauled half its bulk off the highway and through the verge underbrush. heavy shelling from as yet unseen infardi units continued to lacerate the position. with furious las-fire from the injured tank now splashing off the wrath of pardua's front casing, sims ordered his layer to address the other tank coming around the first. re-laying the gun took a vital second. in that time, the second tank fired again and hit the wrath squarely. the impact was enough to lurch all sixty-two tonnes of armoured machine several metres sideways. but it didn't penetrate the twenty-centimetre-thick armour skin. inside, the crew was dazed, and they'd lost most of the forward scopes. sims bellowed to retask, but the tank was now right on them and looming for the kill. a devastating lance of laser fire raked past the wrath and cut through the assaulting vehicle below the turret. internally stored munitions went off and the tank exploded with such force that the main body and track assemblies cartwheeled over in a blistering fireball. the blast wake and shrapnel cleared a semicircle of woodland twenty metres in radius. the destroyer grey venger had struck. from the open cab of his rapidly reversing salamander, mkoll saw the long, low destroyer prowl past, palls of heat discharge spuming from the vent louvres around its massive fixed laser cannon. it nudged aside the burning wreck of farant's dead conqueror and came up alongside the wrath. but the crew of the wrath of pardua had recovered their wits and swiftly nailed the remaining aggressor hard at short range, blowing out its port track sections and shunting it away lame with the shell impact. it began to burn. leguin immediately acknowledged, but mkoll got nothing from sims. fething idiot wants to stay in the fight, mkoll thought. from his machine's tactical auspex, he counted at least ten good-size targets moving up towards their position from bhavnager. but sims suddenly appeared out of the wrath's top hatch, looking back through the gusting smoke to mkoll. the last hit had taken out his vox system and intercom. mkoll made damn sure sims understood his hand signals. the grey venger stood its ground and walloped two more incandescent blasts down the road at targets mkoll couldn't see. probably just discouragement tactics, he thought. who wants to ride an mbt into woodland cover when you know an imperial destroyer is waiting for you? the wrath of pardua reversed hard and swung around to follow the salamanders, traversing its turret to the rear to cover their backs. then, as it too began bravura discouragement shelling, the venger came about and trundled after them all so fast its hull rocked and rose nose up on its well-sprung torsion bar traction. deafened and a little bloodied, the recon spear made off down the highway away from the bombardment, which continued for some fifteen minutes after they had withdrawn. there was no sign of pursuit. mkoll voxed the bad news to gaunt. keeping a weather eye on the northern approaches for signs of the enemy, the recon spear waited to rendezvous with the main honour guard strength at waymark 00.58, a west-facing escarpment of grass pasture fifteen kilometres south of bhavnager. the sun was beginning to sink and the intense heat of the day was dissipating. a southerly was blowing cooler air down from the misty shapes of the sacred hills, which now could be seen rising above the wide green blanket of the rainwoods on the northern horizon. mkoll got out of his salamander, passing bonin who was field stitching the gash in caober's face, and walked towards the wrath of pardua. he took the time to gaze at the sacred hills: dark uplands seventy kilometres away, then behind them, higher peaks fading to an insubstantial grey in the distance. behind them still, about a hundred kilometres beyond, the majestic jagged summits of the sacred hills proper: transparent, icy titans with their heads lost in ribbons of cloud, nine thousand metres above sea level. it was quite a prospect. the fact that getting there involved struggling past at least one enemy tank unit dug into their only guaranteed fuel depot, then rainwood jungle, then increasingly high mountains, made it all the more chilling. thunder, the reveille call of a too hot day in summer, crackled around the neighbouring hills. the taste of rain was a promise on the rising breeze. swells of grey cloud, as mot-tied as imperial air-camo schemes, rolled in from the north, staining a sky that had otherwise been cloudless and blue since the fogs lifted that morning. small chelons and goat-like herbivores grazed and ruminated in the lush meadows beyond the raised pasture of the waymark point. their throat bells clanged dully as they moved. sims and his men were running emergency repairs to the great, wounded wrath of pardua. they were joking and laughing with their captain, revelling in the details of the recent combat and the fact they had come away alive. no one spoke of the dead crew. there would be due time for recognition later. mkoll felt sure that once the obstacle of bhavnager was done with, there would be more than one conqueror to mourn. a figure approached him across the wind-shivered grass. mkoll knew at once it was the so far unseen leguin. he was a short well-made man in his thirties, dressed in tan pardus fatigues and a fleece-lined leather coat. he unbuttoned his leather skull-guard as he approached, unplugging the wire of his headset. mkoll nodded. as the force secured the position, gaunt called his operational and section chiefs for a briefing. they assembled around the back of his salamander: kleopas, rawne, kolea, hark, surgeon curth, tank commanders, squad leaders, platoon sergeants. some brought dataslates, some charts. most clutched tin cups of fresh brewed caffeine or smokes. some of the pardus laughed. why lose the daylight we have left? to a man, the tank soldiers moaned. sirus smiled. there was murmuring. gaunt consulted the assessment reports on-slate. indifferent performance and slow on the fire rate. 105-mil guns as standard. promethium guzzlers with cheap armour, and loose in the rear on a turn. but there's another thing. they continued to shell the roadway for quite a time after we pulled back. i bet that's because they didn't know we'd gone. they had an efficient string of spotters and lookouts, but my guess is their onboard scanners are very much lower spec than ours. no auspex. no landscape readers. until they or their spotters actually see us, they're blind. kleopas, you have command of the main charge. i'll bring the ghosts in behind you. rawne? sirus? you have the side thrust. varl? i want you to play watchdog with a platoon on the road. stay behind the hydras and cover the transport and supply train. bring them in only when we signal the town as secure. go word is �slaydo'. support advance is �oktar'. retreat command is �dercius'. vox channel is beta-kappa-alpha. secondary is kappa-beta-beta. any questions? under kleopas, twelve battle machines charged towards bhavnager from the south, eleven conquerors and the company's single executioner, an ancient plasma tank nicknamed strife. by then, the enemy had seen the smoke and flash of the destroyer kills in the woods and had launched out in force.  thirty-two at70 reavers, all painted gloss lime, plus seven model n20 halftracks mounting 70-mil anti-tank cannons. this was going to be a major engagement. a chance to snatch glory from the din of battle. a chance to find death. the sort of choice the pardus were bred to make. despite the appalling odds, kleopas grinned to himself. the imperial hydras, dug-in and locked out sprayed their drizzle of rapid fire over the town from the tree-line. two thousand ghosts fanned out over the open approach in the wake of kleopas' charging armoured cavalry. already, small arms fire was cracking at them from the town edge. the tank fight began in earnest kleopas' squadron was formed in a trailing v with the heart of destruction at the tip. they had the slight advantage of incline in the cleared ground between the fruit groves and the town edge and were making better than thirty kph. the enemy mass, in no ordered formation, churned up the slope to meet them, kicking rock chips and dry soil out behind them as their tracks dug in. they played out in a long, uneven line. in the command seat of the heart, kleopas checked the readings of his auspex, glowing pale yellow in the halflight of the locked down turret against the eyeball view through his prismatic up-scope. he used his good right eye for this, not his augmetic implant, an affectation his crew often joked about. the layer repeated, jerking the recoil brake. the gun roared. another reaver was reduced to a rapidly expanding ball of fire and scrap. the pardus armour men were trained for mobile cut and thrust. the conquerors' time-honoured torsion-bar suspension systems and high power to weight ratio meant they were more nimble than most of the adversaries they encountered, whether super-heavy monsters or lacklustre mediums like the ones the infardi were fielding. that meant the conquerors were perfect cavalry tanks, built to fight on the move, to charge, to out-manoeuvre and overwhelm the foe. but there came a crucial moment in any armour-cav charge where the decision had to be made to halt, break or break through. kleopas knew that moment was at hand. the dream intention of any armour charge was to utterly crush the target formation. but the infardi outnumbered them three to one, and more tanks were massing at the edge of the town. kleopas cursed� the infardi had mustered in division strength at bhavnager. the major had to keep revising sirus' original estimate up and up. forget about major engagement, this was becoming historic. the conquerors were about to meet the enemy head-on. kleopas had three choices: stop dead and fight it out standing, break through the enemy line and turn to finish the job, or separate and pincer. a stand-up fight was a worst case option. it would allow the reavers to play to their strengths. gaunt cried, and his call was repeated down the infantry file from platoon leader to platoon leader. the ghosts had formed in position at the edge of the tree-line, behind the four raiding hydra batteries, and had been watching in awe and admiration for the last ten minutes as the tank fight boiled across the approach field below. starting to jog, and then to run, the massed force of ghosts came down the field, through the blasted landscape, bayonets fixed. a few shells dropped amongst them. glaring tracers spat overhead. the air was filthy with smoke. kolea led the left-hand point of the advance, sergeant battels the right, with gaunt somewhere between them. gaunt allowed his designated assault leaders to move ahead, confident in their abilities, while he took time to pause and mm to yell encouragement and inspiration to the hundreds of troopers streaming down the slope. he brandished his power sword high so they could see it. right then, he missed brin milo. milo should be here, he thought, piping the ghosts into battle. he yelled again, his voice almost hoarse. commissar hark was advancing with baffels' mob. his shouts and urgings lacked the rousing fire of gaunt's. he was new to them, he hadn't shared what gaunt had shared with them. gaunt looked back to see the grey venger and the death jester rise up on their torsion springs and begin to prowl in at the heels of the infantry. it made a change to advance under armour, gaunt thought. this was the imperial guard at its most efficient. this was inter-speciality co-operation. this was victorious assault. ana curth and the medical party pushed down in the wake of the charging ghosts. the ground they were covering was ruined by the furious tank fight and stank of fuel and fyceline. shells had torn it up, so that the chalky bed rock was ploughed up over the black topsoil in white curds and lumps. it looked to curth as if the very entrails of the earth had been blown out and exposed. this was a dead landscape, and they would undoubtedly extend and enlarge it before they were finished with bhavnager. lesp darted to the left as a ghost went down. the scream rose from the massed confusion of manpower before her. mtane called to her, scrambling over the broken ground to a ghost who was hunched over a squealing, disembowelled friend. this is hell, curth thought. it was her first taste of open war, of full-scale battle. she'd been through the urban horrors of vervunhive, but had only ever read about the experience of pitched war in exposed territory. battlefields. now she understood what the term meant. it took a lot to shock ana curth, and death and injury wasn't enough. what shocked her here was the raging, callous fury of the battle. the scale, the size, the gak-awful noise, the mass charge. the mass wounding. she pulled open her field kit, running forward between the plumes of fire kicked up by falling shells and heavy las-fire. every time she thought she knew the horrors of war, it gleefully exposed new ones. from waymark 07.07, the side thrust began their assault. they congregated a kilometre to the east of bhavnager at an outlying farm. even from this distance, the thunder of the main assault four kilometres away was shaking the ground. rawne spat in the dust and picked up the lasrifle he had lent against the farmyard's drybrick perimeter wall. three to sirus. the six conquerors roared out of their holding position and charged across the open fields and meadows towards the eastern edge of the town. behind them came the convoy's eight remaining salamanders. rawne hopped up onto the running boards of one of the command salamanders and rode it in, turning back to supervise the infantry group advancing behind him. the five conquerors chasing sirus' wrath of pardua were named say your prayers, fancy klara, steel storm, lucky bastard and lion of pardua, the latter the wrath's sister tank. rocking over terrain humps and irrigation gullies, the pardus machines began firing, their shots hammering at the looming temple and its precincts. puffs of white smoke plumed from the distant hits silently. almost immediately, four at70 tanks appeared around the northern side of the temple two spurred forward into the edges of the wet arable land, the others stopped dead and commenced shelling.  the fancy klara, commanded by lieutenant letaw, crippled one of the moving tanks with a beautiful long range shot that would have made woll himself proud. but then, as it bounced up over a tilled field, a tungsten-cored tank round hit the klara squarely, penetrating the turret mantle and puncturing down through the basket. letaw lost his right arm and his gunlayer was instantly liquidised. the incandescent shell pierced the water jackets of the klara's magazine and didn't explode. the conqueror swerved to a halt. letaw was numb with shock. he could barely pull aside his seat harness to look round. the interior of the turret was painted with a slick film of gore, the only remaining physical trace of his layer. filthy water from the jackets dribbled out, diluting the blood on the floor. he could see sizzling fire inside the hole, the heat-shock residue of the impact. he cried. letaw repeated, reaching for the escape hatch pull with an arm that was no longer there. laughing at the macabre oddness of it, he swung around and reached up with his remaining hand. he heard the driver scrambling out through the forward hatch. with a pop, heat-exchanger conduits in the side of the turret, weakened by the shell impact, burst. scalding water spurted out, hitting letaw in the face before cascading down to broil his loader. letaw tried to scream. the loader's shrieks echoed around the tank interior. the shell had severed electrical cables in the footwell of the turret. the swirling water met the fizzling ends. letaw and his loader were electrocuted even as they writhed and screamed and blistered. targeting a stationary at70, the steel storm exchanged shot after shot with it. lieutenant hellier, commanding the steel storm, realised his inertial dampers were damaged and that his auspex must consequently be out. he shut the electronic systems down and began to aim through the reticule of the up-scope. he called out lay numbers to his aimer and was about to make a confident kill when the tank exploded, flipped over and broke apart. the steel storm had hit the edge of the so-far undetected mine-field east of bhavnager. the wrath of pardua crossed into the field immediately behind it, losing track pins and part of its side plating to an exploding mine. gunning its drive into full reverse, it was able to limp backwards a few metres while sims called an urgent dead stop. the three remaining conquerors slewed up behind him. bouncing up to their rear, the salamander formations drew out in a line abreast, the infantry herding in around them. rawne ordered into his vox. rawne yelled. the ghosts began firing at the edge of the town with lasrifles, and with the heavier infantry support weapons they had brought up: four heavy stubbers and three missile launchers, plus the heavy bolters and the autocannons hullmounted on the salamanders. the sweeper squads were miserably exposed, working their delicate magic as tank rounds and small arms fire whooshed around them. they had the expertise to clear a corridor through the field � if they lived long enough. the second front advance was now dangerously delayed. more at70s appeared in support of the existing trio, as well as a quartet of heavy usurper self-propelleds. sims wondered just how much bloody armour the enemy had to draw on at bhavnager. deadlocked by the mines, the four conquerors began free-firing at the enemy position with main guns and coaxial mounts. in the space of a few seconds, the lion of pardua comprehensively destroyed a self-propelled gun thoroughly enough to ignite its munition pile, and the lucky bastard knocked out an at70. the detonation of the selfpropelled gun was severe enough to spray shrapnel out over the minefield and trigger a few of the buried munitions off. the say your prayers and sirus' wrath of pardua slung over some tank rounds that blew out the north retaining wall of the temple. the wrath's driver and a pardus tech-priest from the salamanders took the opportunity to rig running repairs on the conqueror's damaged track section. it was a shoulder tube of khaki-painted metal with a fore-scope, a trigger brace and fluted venturi at the back end to vent the recoil exhaust. heavy support weapons like this weren't commonly deployed by the stealth-specialist ghosts; in fact bragg was often the only trooper carrying one. but they were in the middle of a tank fight now. caffran shouldered the tube and aimed via the crude wire crosshairs at the at70 that had duelled with the late, lamented steel storm. like many ghosts, caffran had become familiar with tread-fethers during the street-to-street war at vervunhive, where he'd used one to knock out five zoican siege tanks. in fact he'd been fielding one in the burning habs when criid had turned up to save his life from zoican storm troops. they'd been together ever since. she yelled. he ordered. everyone nearby echoed the word, so that their mouths would be open when the tube fired. anyone with closed mouths risked burst eardrums from the sudden firing pressure. with a hollow, whistling cough, the tread-fether shot the rocket grenade at the enemy, leaving a slowly dissolving con-trail of smoke behind it. the hit was clean, but the rocket exploded impotently off the heavy front armour of the reaver. as if goaded, the at70 came around. now that was better. the at70 shuddered and began to burn. the burning at70 now shivered and exploded in a blizzard of machine parts, armour plating, track segments and fire.a cheer rippled down the infantry lines. then, above the ceaseless waning, the sound of another, louder cheer. rawne leapt out of his salamander to investigate, running hunched as tracer fire crackled over his position. larkin had scored magnificently with his first shot of the engagement. it was one hell of a shot. trooper neskon yelled.  one of the unit's flamer troopers, neskon was reduced to firing his laspistol, his flame-gun pretty much redundant in these mid � to long-range conditions. rawne asked larkin. larkin said. the voice of rawne's adjutant had always been deep and gravelly, but ever since the final fight for veyveyr gate, he'd spoken through a voicebox deformed and twisted with las-burn scar tissue. he was permanently monotone and deadpan. feygor scrambled around and selected cuu, banda and the verghast sniper twenish to accompany himself and larkin. under the storm of fire, the quintet moved out into the killing field. domor's party, working alongside burone's, had cleared a ten metre wide channel that ran thirty metres into the field, its edges carefully denoted by staked tapes laid by trooper memmo. one of burone's squad was already dead and mkor in domor's had taken shrapnel in his left thigh and shoulder. domor's team was slightly ahead of burone's, and this competition was a matter of pride between tanith and verghastite minesweepers. domor, of course, had the advantage of his heat-reading augmetic eyes to back up the sweeper brooms. feygor's intruder team joined them, larkin and twenish immediately digging in and sighting up as cuu and banda gave them cover fire. the vulnerable sweepers were glad of the additional support. twenish was a damn good shot, larkin noted. he was one of the very few verghastite newcomers to have specialised in sniper school before the act of consolation. a long-limbed, humourless fellow, twenish was ex- vervun primary, a career soldier. his long-las was newer than larkin's nalwood-furnished beauty; a supremely functional weapon with grotesquely enlarged night-scope array, a bipod stand and a ceramite stock individually tailored to fit its user. the two snipers, products of entirely diverging regimental schools and training, began firing at the enemy armour. from three shots, larkin dropped a usurper gunlayer, an infantry leader, and the commander of an at70 who had made the mistake of spotting from his turret hatch. twenish fired in quick double-shots. if the first didn't kill, it at least found range and drew his aim to his target for the second. from three of these paired shots, he made two excellent kills, including an infardi priest rousing his men to combat. but to larkin, it seemed like wasted effort. he knew about the double-shot method, and also was aware that many guard regiments taught the approach as standard. in his opinion, it gave the enemy too much warning, no matter how quickly you adjusted for the second squeeze. as he lined up again , larkin began to find the crack-pause-crack of twenish's routine off-putting. twenish was obsessive in his care, laying out a sheet of vizzy-cloth beside his firing position that he used to polish clean the scope lenses between each double-shot. like a fething machine� crack-pause-crack�. polish-polish� crackpause- crack. enough with the precious rituals! larkin felt like yelling, though he had more than enough of his own. larkin snuggled in again and with one shot killed the driver of a halftrack that was moving into the opposition line. banda, cuu and feygor knelt in the folds of soil, blazing suppressing fire freely at the enemy. banda was an excellent shot, and like many of her kind � female verghastite conscripts, that was � she had wanted to specialise in marksmanship on joining the ghosts. as it was, there was a strict limit on numbers for that specialisation and she'd been denied, although, to banda's delight, her friend nessa had made it. most of the marksman places went to vervun primary snipers like twenish who were carrying their specialisation over into the ghosts with them. but banda could shoot damn well, even with a standard, bulk-stamped las-rifle� a fact she'd proved to the gak-ass major rawne in the universitariat clearance. a swathe of autogun fire rippled across the position of the sweepers and the intruder team and every one threw themselves down. the remaining member of burone's team was shredded, and burone himself was hit in the hip. as they all got up again, banda was first to realise that twenish was dead; hammered into the soil in his prone position by the stitching fire that had raked over them. without hesitating , she leapt forward and prised the verghastite long-las from twenish's stiff grip. he knew how brilliantly � if psychotically � cuu could shoot. if cuu wanted a piece of it, let him get his belly dirty and use the damn long-las. at least banda was eager. and damn good. he'd always suspected that about her. since the day he'd first met her at street junction 281/kl in the suburbs of vervunhive. the cheeky fething bitch. as domor's squad continued forward with their unenviably deadly task, and a fresh sweeper team ran forward to replace burone's unit, the two ghost snipers plied their precise and murderous trade across the enemy positions. rawne told gaunt via his salamander's powerful voxcaster set. south of bhavnager, the infantry forces were swarming into the town itself on the smoking heels of the pardus main armour. tanks were engaging the enemy at short range now, in the limiting spaces of the narrow market area streets. woll's old strontium knocked out three n20 anti-tankers during this phase of close armour, and hit a usurper before it could train its huge tank-killing weapon down to fire. kloepas' heart of destruction was caught in a firelight with two reavers, and the conquerors xenophobe and tread softly smashed down low corral walls and single-storey brick-built houses as they moved to support it. the executioner tank strife, flanked by the conquerors beat the retreat and p48j, crushed a squadron of halftracks and broke into the compound of the south-western produce barns. kolea's troop spearhead swiftly moved up to support them, enduring a series of fierce, close range fights through the echoing interiors of the barns.  mkoll's scout force pushed through towards the town centre marketplace after an ambiguous but deadly confrontation in the yards of the warehouses, where bales of dried vines were stacked. a platoon under corporal meryn fought their way in after them, meeting a counter-assault massed by fifty infardi gunmen. the flame-troopers, typified by brostin and dremmond and the verghastite lubba, excelled themselves during this part of the fight, sweeping clean the hard-locked barns of any infardi resistance. accompanied by vox-officer beltayn, gaunt advanced through the promethium smoke and the fyceline discharge. sergeant baffel's replied, his voice eerily distorted by electromagnetics. the fuel depot. at waymark 00.60, standing amid the parked tankers, chimeras, trojans and troop trucks, they could hear the rumble of battle from away through the trees at bhavnager. varl's defence section stood about aimlessly, talking with the waiting munitorium drivers, smoking, cleaning kit. varl paced up and down. he so fething wanted to get down there and into it. varl looked round. trooper unkin was approaching. unkin pointed at the ragged old ayatani, zweil. he wandered down to the old priest. caustic smoke was rolling down the length of the side street obscuring kolea's view. somewhere down there, somewhere close to the point where the street met the main through road just off the market square, an enemy halftrack was sitting and chopping fire from its pintle-mount at anything that moved. every now and then, it fired its anti-tank gun too. the wretched smoke was pouring out of a threshing mill close by. las-fire whimpered down the thoroughfare. the tightly packed buildings in the side street degraded vox-quality. it reminded kolea rather too much of the fighting in the outhabs of vervunhive. corporal meryn's platoon, fresh from their firefight in the barns, moved up behind kolea's bunch. kolea signalled meryn by hand to force a way through the buildings to the left and out onto the street running parallel to the one that currently stymied the advance. meryn acknowledged. bonin, one of the scouts, had peeled to the right and found a walk-through breezeway that opened onto a small area of open wasteland behind the street buildings. hearing this over the vox kolea immediately sent venar, wheln, fenix and jajjo through to link up with bonin. from cover, kolea continued to scrutinize the billowing smoke for signs of the gakking n20. after a while, he began to fire off rounds into the section of smoke his instinct said concealed it. he was sure he could hear his shots impacting off hull metal. a heavy burst of stub fire raked back in response, chewing into the rubble and debris on the street. almost immediately, it was followed by a whistling bang as the anti-tank weapon fired. the shell, travelling , it seemed to kolea, at head height, impacted explosively in a burnt-out hut behind kolea's position. as it sped through the smoke, the projectile left behind a bizarre corkscrew wake pattern. confirmed foot targets! seena was a plump, twenty-five year old girl who wore a black slouch cap to keep her luxuriant bangs out of her eyes; arilla was skinny, barely eighteen. somehow it looked wrong for the frailer, shorter girl to always be the one lugging the hollow plasteel yoke laden with ammo hoppers. but they were an excellent team. their matt-black stubber was packed into the lip of the foxhole tightly to prevent the tripod skating out during sustained fire. those old-pattern stubbers could buck like a riled auroch. seena was squirting out tight bursts, interspersing them with longer salvoes that she sluiced from side to side on the gunstand's oiled gimbal. ezlan and mkoyn tossed out a few tube-charges that detonated with satisfying thumps and collapsed the street facade of a farrier's shop. kolea got a few shots off himself, moving along the defence line. another anti-tank round screamed low overhead. kolea hoped the infantry clash would bring the halftrack up in support of its troops. he got loglas and viwo to prep their missile tube. a particularly heavy spray of las-fire stippled the wall behind him, and kolea ducked flat. he heard the stubber barking out in response. the channel just bled white noise. kolea could hear staccato crossfire from behind the structures to his right. bonin's fire-team needed help. within two minutes, a platoon had moved up from the warehouses along the route his team had already cleared. kolea's old friend sergeant haller was at the head of it. kolea quickly outlined the situation and the suspected position of the n20 to haller and then grouped up a fire-team of livara, ezlan, mkoyn and, from haller's detail, trooper surch and the flamer-man lubba. as if it had been waiting for the verghastite hero to go, the halftrack suddenly clanked forward through the pungent brown smoke and fired its main mount at the ghost line. two of haller's new arrivals were killed and loglas was wounded by flying debris. haller yelled at viwo. viwo confirmed. haller sighted up. the rocket tore open the halftrack's cab armour like a can-opener, and exploded out with enough force to spin the entire anti-tank mount around. seena and arilla hosed the stricken machine with stub-fire. there was a ragged ripple of cheers from the ghosts. bonin's advance team had run into ferocious and extraordinary opposition centring on a shell-damaged building at the edge of the wasteground. more than twenty infardi weapons had fired on them and then, incredibly, dozens of green-clad warriors had charged out brandishing cleavers, pikes and rifle bayonets. the five ghosts reacted with extreme levels of improvisation. fenix had been winged in the initial fire, but he was still fit to fight, and dropped to his knees, presenting a smaller target as he fired at the mob rushing them. wheln and venar had already fixed bayonets and countered directly, uttering blood-chilling yells as they drove forward, slashing and impaling. bonin sprayed his lasgun on full auto, draining out the powercell swiftly but harvesting the opposition. jajjo was carrying the loaded tread-fether and decided not to waste the stopping power. he shouldered the tube and fired the anti-tank round into the face of the building the infardi had charged out of. the back-blast took out several of the skirmishers and collapsed a section of the wall. then jajjo tossed his tube aside and leapt into the close fighting, his silver blade in his hand. his powercell depleted, bonin joined in the hand to hand too, dubbing with his gunstock. the imperials, trained by the likes of feygor and mkoll at this sort of fighting, out-classed the cultists, despite the latter's superior numbers and bigger, slashing blades. but the infardi had frenzy in them, and that made them lethal opponents. bonin broke a jaw with a swing of his lasgun, and then smacked the muzzle of his weapon into the solar plexus of another attacker. what the feth had made them charge out like this, he wondered? it was bizarre, even by the unpredictable standards of the chaos-polluted foe. they had cover and they clearly had guns. they could have taken bonin's intruder unit in the open. the brutal melee lasted for four minutes and only ended when the last of the infardi were dead or unconscious. bonin's team were all splashed with the enemy's gore and the wasteground was soaked. corpses sprawled all around. the ghosts had all sustained cuts and contusions: bonin had a particularly deep laceration across his left upper arm and jajjo had a broken wrist. bonin could feel the adrenalin surging through his body, the rushing beat of his own heart. he knew his team must be feeling the same way too, and wanted to use it before they ebbed out of that intense combat edge. he slammed a fresh powercell into his weapon. let's get in there and secure the damn place fast. jajjo, use your pistol. said kolea, looking at the bloody evidence of the fight. bonin nodded. ezlan suggested. the sounds of close fighting rolled in from the neighbouring street, but haller had informed meryn that the n20 had been killed and advised him to press on. night was now falling fast, and the darkening sky was lit all around by firelight, the flashes of explosions and the glimmer of tracers. by mkoll's guess, the fight was not yet even half done. the tanith were still a long way from taking bhavnager or securing their primary objective, the fuel depot. strangely, the street they advanced down, a narrow lane lined with empty dwellings and plundered trading posts, was untouched by the fighting, intact, almost peaceful. mkoll wished urgently for full darkness. this phase of the day when light turned into night was murder on the eyes. night vision refused to settle in. the bright moons were up, shrouded by palls of rising smoke that turned them blood red. meryn suddenly made a movement and fired. swiftly, all the ghosts opened up, moving into secure cover. odd bursts of gunfire came back at them, chipping the bricks and stucco walls of the commonplace buildings. squat and ominous like a brooding toad, the at70 crumpled a fence as it rolled out onto the road, traversing its turret to fire down on them again. meryn growled. the one tool they had that might make a dent in the tank was down. they were caught cold. infardi troops streamed in behind the reaver, blasting away. a serious small arms firefight developed, lighting up the dim street with its strobing brilliance. the tank rolled on, crashing heedlessly over the dead or wounded forms of its own foot troops. meryn shuddered.  it would soon be doing the same to his boys. from his position, he could hear mkoll urgently talking over the vox. he waited until mkoll broke off before patching in. easy for mkoll to say, meryn thought. the tank was barely seventy metres away now, its 105-mil barrel lowered to maximum declension. it fired again, putting a crater in the road, and its coaxial weapon began chattering. meryn heard two ghosts cry out as they were hit by the spray of bolter rounds. the infardi troops were moving up all around. this was turning into a full-on counter thrust meryn wondered what the feth mkoll intended to do about the tank. he hoped it wasn't some insane, suicidal ran with a satchel of tube-charges. even mkoll wouldn't be that crazy, would he? then again, he hoped mkoll had something up his guard-issue sleeve. the at70 was going to be all over them in a moment. his vox crackled. what the feth�? a horizontal column of light, as thick as meryn's own thigh, raked down the narrow street from the rear. it was so bright its afterimage seared meryn's retinas for minutes afterwards. there was a stink of ozone. the at70 blew up. its turret and main gun, spinning like a child's discarded rattle, separated from the hull in the fireball and demolished the upper storey of a house. the hull itself split open like a roasting nalnut shell in a campfire and showered flames and metal fragments everywhere. meryn stammered. hold you to that. form up and follow me in. let's get this finished. supported by the blistering firepower of the pardus, the ghosts moved forward towards the depot. leading one line, gaunt found himself suddenly face to face with infardi who had laid low and dug in, now springing out in ambush to the file. his power sword sang and his bolter spat. around him, uril, harjeon, soric and lillo, some of the best of the verghastite new blood, proved themselves worthy ghosts. it was the first of seventeen separate handto- hand engagements the prong would encounter on the way up. at the fifth, a messy firefight to clear a oil de sac, chance brought gaunt and hark up side by side in the mayhem. hark's plasma pistol seared into the shadows. hark said, destroying an enemy stub-nest with a single, volatile beam. gaunt replied tardy and, without waiting for a response, rallied his ghosts for the next assault. sergeant bray was the first platoon leader in baffels' group to break his men through to the fuel depot proper. he found a row of massive sheds and chubby fuel tanks, guarded by over a hundred dug-in infardi, supported by three at70s and a pair of usurpers. bray's rocket teams got busy. this was the heaviest resistance they'd yet encountered, and the attack had hardly been a picnic up until then. bray called up for armour support. gaunt, baffels, soric and hark clawed in, each driving a solid formation of ghosts up to the rear of bray's position. gaunt could taste victory, and defeat too, intertwined. experience told him that this was the moment, the make or break. if they endured and pushed on, they would win the town and destroy the foe. if not� shell, las and hard-round fire whipped into his formation. he saw the pardus go forward, smashing through chainlink fences and across ditches as they breached the depot compound. strife killed a usurper, and death jester crippled a reaver. baneblade! gaunt yelled into his vox. captain woll, commanding the old strontium, couldn't believe his ears. his auspex picked up the behemoth a second before it fired and obliterated the conqueror tread softly. woll layed in and fired, but his tank round barely made a dent on the massive machine's hull. the baneblade's secondary and sponson turrets began to fire on the imperial positions. the immediate death toll was hideous. hark yelled at the fleeing tanith around him. hark was suddenly jerked backwards as gaunt seized his wrist tightly and spoiled the threatened aim of his plasma pistol. sorry, chief. he insisted. thanks for looking after him, varl. zweil closed baffels' clouded eyes. said bragg. dorden had walked away down to the river, and stood casting stones aimlessly into the inky water. he started as someone came up beside him in the close dark. it was the esholi, sanian. i saw you. the imperium is great, its wonders are manifold, but what of it would remain but for war? its people? its learning? its culture? its language? nothing. war encompasses all. dorden sighed. she was right. after a fashion. i left there to become esholi and find my way. now, even if my way in life is revealed to me, there will be nothing for me to return home to, when this is done. because it will never be done. war is eternal. corbec nodded. vamberfeld sat down on a tree stump at the edge of the road. rain was in the air, and a true storm was gathering in defiance of the man-made one to the west. the wind stirred their hair and the first few spats of rain dropped around them. under the raised cowling of the chimera, daur and greer worked at the engines. vamberfeld could hear corbec talking to milo just a few steps away from where he sat. it would be, he supposed, the easiest thing in the world just to stand up, get the colonel's attention, and talk to him, man to man. the easiest thing� he couldn't do it. even now, he could feel the terror crawling back into him, in through his pores, in through his veins, squirming and slithering down along his gut and up into the recesses of his mind. he began to shake. it was so unfair. on verghast in the towering hive he'd enjoyed a quiet life working as guilder naslquey's personal clerk in the commercia, signing dockets, arranging manifests, chasing promissory notes. he'd been good at that. he'd lived in a decent little hab on spine low-231, with a promise of status promotion. he'd been very much in love with his fianc� e, an apprentice seamstress with bocider's. then the zoican war had taken it all away. his job, his little hab, to an artillery shell; his fianc� e to� well, he didn't know what. he'd never been able to find out what had happened to his clear, sweet little seamstress. and that was all terrible. he'd lived through days and nights of fear, of hiding in ruins, of running scared, of starving. but he'd lived through them, and come out sane. because of that, he'd decided he was man enough to turn his back on the ruins of his life and join the imperial guard when the act of consolation made that possible.  it had felt like the right thing to do. he'd known fear during the war, and renewed the acquaintance again. the fear of leaving verghast, never to return. the anxiety of warp travel in a stinking, confined troop ship. the trepidation of failing during the bonewearying first week of fundamental and preparatory. the true terror, the unexpected terror had come later. the first time, wriggling and chuckling at the back of his scalp, during the hagia mass landings. he'd shaken it off. he'd been through hell on verghast, he told himself. this was just the same kind of hell. then it had come again, in the first phase of the assault on the doctrinopolis. in real fighting, for the first time, as a real soldier. men died alongside him or, worse still as it seemed to vamberfeld, were dismembered or hideously mutilated by war. those first few days had left him shaking inside. the terror would not now leave him alone. it simply subsided a little between engagements. vamberfeld had decided that he needed to kill. to make a kill, as a soldier, to exorcise his terror. the chance had finally come when he'd been with gaunt as they breached the universitariat from across the square of sublime tranquillity. to be baptised in war, to be badged in blood. he had been willing, and eager. he had wanted combat. he had wanted relief from the terror-daemon that was by then riding his back all the time. but it had only made things worse. he'd come out of that encounter shaking like an idiot, unable to focus or talk. he'd come out a total slave to that daemon. it was so bloody unfair. bragg and derin had recruited him from the hospital wards for this mission. he could hardly have refused them� he was able-bodied and that made him useful. no one seemed to see the cackling, oil-black terror clinging to him. bragg and derin had said corbec had an important mission, and that was alright. vamberfeld liked the colonel. it seemed vital. the colonel had talked about holy missions and visions. that was fine too. it had been easy for vamberfeld to play along with that. easy to pass off his nervousness and pretend the saint had spoken to him as well, and ear-marked him for the task. it was all a sham. he was just saying what he thought they wanted to hear. the only thing that really spoke to him was the cackling daemon. the words of the driver, greer, had alarmed him. his talk of gold, of complicity with captain daur. vamberfeld wondered if they were all mocking him. he was now pretty sure they were all bastard-mercenaries, breaking orders not because of some lofty, holy ideal but because of a base lust for wealth. and so he felt a fool for acting the part of the dutiful visionary. his hands shook. he tucked them into his pockets in the hope that no one would see. his body shook. his mind shook. the terror consumed him. he cursed the daemon for fooling him into throwing in with a band of deserters and thieves. he cursed the daemon for making him shake. he cursed the daemon for being there at all. he wanted to get up and tell corbec about his terror, but he was shaking so much he couldn't. and even if he could, he knew they'd most likely laugh in his face and shoot him in the bushes. vamberfeld realised the rain was falling hard now, bouncing off his face and shoulders. warm rainwater began to leak down vamberfeld's neckline and over his wrists. he turned his face up to look into the downpour, wishing that it would wash the terror away. corbec took a deep swig of the biting liquor and used it to swallow a handful more painkillers. he was sucking in way too many of them, he knew. he hurt so, he needed them. corbec followed bragg's gesture and looked across the rain-pelted road at the figure seated with its back to them. greer smiled, and wiped the rain off his face with a cuff that stained the streaks of water running down his brow with machine oil. corbec smiled, sheltering from the rain under the open hatch of the chimera. her hand signs were too quick for him as usual. is the saint really calling to you? he knew his clumsy gestures only conveyed the pigeon-essence of his words. captain daur says he has heard her, she signed expressively. wrong in what way? corbec yelled, calling them all back to the repaired transport. vamberfeld woke up suddenly, finding himself lying on his side in the rain-pounded mud. he'd passed out and fallen from the tree stump.  he got to his feet weak and shivering, fumbled for his gun and ran back towards the brightly lit transport. he cast a final look back into the dark trees. the girl and her chelons had vanished. but the daemon was still there. pulling his shaking hand into his jacket to hide it, he climbed into the chimera. daybreak, streaming rain in lament over the smoking battleground, came up on bhavnager. waking early in his tent, gaunt leapt up suddenly and then remembered the battle was done. he sat back on the tan canvas seat of his folding stool and sighed. a half-empty bottle of amasec sat on the map table nearby. he began to reach for it and then decided not to. beyond his tent, he heard the grumble of tank engines being overhauled by the tech-priests. he heard the clank of the fuel bowsers as they replenished the transports. he heard the whine of hoists as tank magazines were reloaded from the chimeras. he heard the moan of the wounded in curth's makeshift infirmary. gaunt nodded distractedly. he got up, pulling off his blood-, soot- and oil-streaked vest replacing it with a fresh one from his kit the braces of his uniform pants dangling loose around his hips, he washed his face with handfuls of water from the jug and then slipped the braces up, putting on a shirt and his black dolman jacket with its rows of gold buttons and froggjng. bhavnager. what a victory. what a loss. he was still shaking from the combat, from the ebbing adrenalin and the weariness. he had slept for about three hours, and that fitfully. mad dreams, confused dreams, dreams spawned by extreme fatigue and the memories of what he had been through. he had seen himself on a narrow shelf of ice, with the world far below, clinging on, about to fall, hurricanes of fire falling around him. sergeant baffels had appeared, alive and whole. he'd been on the lip of ice, and had reached over to grab gaunt's hands. he'd pulled gaunt up, onto solid ground. gaunt grabbed the bottle and poured a deep measure into his dirty shot glass. under kolea's instruction, the honour guard buried their dead � almost two hundred of them � in a mass grave beside the temple at bhavnager. the trojans could have dug the pit but the pardus conquerors old strontium, beat the retreat, p48j and heart of destruction did the honours with their dozer blades, even though their crews were half dead with fatigue. ayatani zweil was prevailed upon to make the service of the dead. the ghosts dutifully staked small crosses cut from ghylum wood in rows across the turned earth, one for each of the dead who slept beneath. the day came up, warm, muggy and blighted with heavy rain. gaunt knew it would take weeks for a unit to recover from the shock of an action as fundamentally brutal as bhavnager, but he didn't have weeks. he barely had days. at nine in the morning, he called the honour guard to order for an hour's prep and sent the recon spear out in advance into the rainwoods above the town. though tired, the men in his command seemed generally to be in good spirits. a solid victory, and against such odds, would do that, despite the losses. the pardus were more sombre than the ghosts: they seemed more to be mourning the beloved machines they'd lost rather than the men. gaunt crossed the town square and stopped by a small timber store where troopers cocoer, waed and garond were guarding the infardi officer bonin's squad had taken the night before. no other infardi troops had been taken alive. gaunt presumed that was because the infardi took their wounded with them or killed them. the vile, tattooed thing was chained up like a canid at the back of the shed. gaunt nodded. the pardus officers shuffled uneasily. rawne shook his head with a dry laugh. then gaunt roused up the main force and pushed on into the rainwoods, leaving the lowlands and bhavnager behind in their dust. knots of ghost and pardus personnel watched the convoy depart. i am familiar with that notion, gaunt. the cry went down the convoy to remount. he hoped none of the remark's irony would be lost. forty minutes north of the main convoy, the recon spearhead was slowing to a crawl. rawne had chosen to accompany mkoll's forward unit. for this, the third day, the spear comprised two scout salamanders, a hydra flak tractor, the destroyer grey venger and the conqueror say your prayers. the track was narrowing right down, so tight that the tree cover was beginning to meet overhead and the hulls of the big tanks brushed the foliage. mkoll kept checking the chart-slates to make sure they weren't off course. mkoll yelled. he'd barely uttered the words when las-fire stung out of the undergrowth alongside them. rounds spanged off the vehicle hulls or tore overhanging leaves. the driver of the lead salamander was hit in the neck and fell back into his machine's crewbay with a shriek. mkoll dived into cover behind the cycad trunk next to rawne. the ghosts were firing back now, but they could see nothing to aim at. even lillo, who happened to be in the crewbay of the lead salamander and therefore had an auspex to refer to, could find no target. rawne ordered, over his vox. the coaxial and pintle mounts of the machines stuttered into life, raking the leaf canopy to shreds with heavy washes of fire. a moment later, sergeant horkan's hydra drowned them all out as it commenced firing. the four, long barrelled autocannons of its anti-aircraft mount swivelled around and blasted simultaneous streams of illuminator rounds into the woodlands at head height, cropping trees, shredding bushes, pulverising ferns, liquidising foliage. a stinking mist of vaporised plant matter and aspirated sap filled the trackway, making the troops choke and retch. after thirty seconds' auto-fire, the hydra ceased. apart from the drizzle of canopy moisture, the collapse of destroyed plants and the clicking of the hydra's autoloader as it cycled, there was silence. the hydra was designed to bring down combat aircraft at long range. point-blank, against a soft target of vegetation, it had cut a clearing in the rainwood fifty metres deep and thirty across. a few denuded, broken trunks stood up amid the leaf-pulp. mkoll and caober moved forward to check the area. the partially disintegrated remains of two infardi lay amid the green destruction. there was no sign of further attack. rawne ordered. at this rate, if the damn infardi dropped a tree every few kilometres, it was going to take weeks to cross these rainwoods. about a hundred and twenty kilometres south of the rainwoods, a lone chimera coughed its way down the dusty highway through an empty, abandoned village called mukret.  the day was glaring hot, and greer kept a close eye on the temp-gauges. the old heap's panting turbine was redlining regularly, and twice now they'd had to stop, dump the boiling water-mix in the coolant system and replace it with water drawn from the river in jerry cans. now they were out of coolant chemicals, and the mix in the flushed out system was so dilute it was essentially running on river water alone. he needed to stretch his legs anyway, and maybe there would be time to show daur a little more of the skills needed to drive the machine. an ability to swap drivers meant they would be able to keep going longer without rest stops. corbec's team dismounted into the sunlight and the dry air, seeking shelter at once under the ferns. the cabin fans and recirculators in the chimera weren't working either, so it was like going on a long journey in an oven. corbec, daur and milo consulted the chart. he turned aside, unpopped his water flask and knocked down a pill or two. nearby, at the river's edge, vamberfeld stood in the shallows skipping stones out over the flat water between the reed beds. a slight breeze stirred the feathery rushes on the far bank, which were starkly ash-white against the baked, blue sky. he made one skip four times. concentrating on simple actions like that helped him to control the shaking in his hand. the water was soothingly cool against his legs. he skipped another. just before it made its fifth bounce, a much larger stone flew out over his head and fell with a dull splash into the river. vamberfeld looked round. bragg gingerly stepped out into the shallows, steering his clumsy bulk unsteadily over the loose stones of the bed. vamberfeld thought for a moment. no, like this. flat to the water. now, it's in the wrist. make it spin as you release. yes! three! good shot! five there! can you do six? don't look. no. no. no no no no. shockingly loud, a lasrifle fired right behind them, the echo of the snap-roar rolling across the wide river. bragg reeled round and saw nessa crouched in a braced position on the bank, her long-las resting across a twist of roots. she fired again, out across the water. bragg cried. his vox-link came alive. he cried again. nessa fired a third, then a fourth shot. derin was yelling into his link. las-fire was punching up and churning the water right across the shallows. bragg turned to vamberfeld and saw to his horror the man was frozen, his eyes rolled back, his entire body spasming and vibrating. blood and froth coated his chin. bragg grabbed the convulsing verghastite and threw him over his shoulder. his wound screamed out in protest but he didn't care. he started struggling his way towards the shore. derin was now firing on auto with his assault las in support of nessa's hot-shots. enemy rounds cut through the trunk and branches of the old trees above them with a peculiar, brittle sound. corbec, daur and milo appeared at the top of the bank, weapons raised. a las-shot grazed bragg's left buttock and he yowled. another missed dorden's head by a hand's breadth and a third hit the doctor's medikit and blew it open. dorden and bragg manhandled vamberfeld ashore and then dragged him up the bank into the cover of the roadwall. the five ghosts behind them unleashed a steady salvo of fire at the far bank. glancing back, bragg saw at least one raft of green silk floating in the water. greer ran up from the chimera, clutching bragg's auto-cannon. sanian followed him, a stricken look of fear on her face. greer asked, gazing in sick horror at the weirdly vibrating vamberfeld. vamberfeld's shaking hands were twisted into claw-shapes by the extreme muscular spasm. dorden snarled. bragg snatched the autocannon from greer and ran back to the bank, locking in a drum-mag. the enemy fire was still heavy. ten or twelve shooters, bragg estimated. as he settled down to fire , he saw another infardi tumble into the river, hit by nessa. clouds of downy white fibre were rising like wheat chaff from the rushes where the imperial firepower was mashing it. bragg opened fire. his initial burst chopped into the river in a row of tall splashes. corbec yelled. the gunfire from the opposite bank had stopped. a muted chorus of answers. dorden turned round from the supine vamberfeld who was laid on a bed roll on the floor of the cargo bay. right. support. can we all do that? greer? so it was that the wounded wagon began to thread its way up north along the sooka after dark that night, running east of the holy river. the track was very narrow for the most part, and its course worn into a deep trough by millennia of plodding feet. the chimera slithered and bounced, jarring violently. once in a while, members of the team had to dismount and clear overgrowth by the light of the hull searchlight. they were now over a hundred and fifty kilometres behind the honour guard advance, travelling slower, and diverging steadily away to the north. vamberfeld slept. he dreamed of the herd-girl, her calf chelons and her piercing eyes. � saint sabbat, biographica hagia ghosts. ice-clad ghosts. giants looming, impossibly tall, out of the dry, distant haze. it had taken two full days for the honour guard column to crawl and squirm its way up through the dense, dark, smelly rainwoods. there had been sixteen random, inconsequential ambushes along the way. gaunt's forces had skirmished with unseen harriers who left only a few dead behind. the progress lost gaunt eighteen more men, one scout salamander and a chimera. but now, at dawn on the sixth day out from the doctrinopolis, the honour guard began the laborious climb out of the rainwoods' humid mist and into the feet of the sacred hills. above and around them, the mountain range rose up like silent monsters. they were already passing three thousand metres above sealevel.  some of the surrounding mountains topped out at over ten thousand metres. the air was cool and dry, and the highland path ran through flat raised valleys where the soil was desiccated and golden. few plants grew, except a wind-twitching gorse, rock-crusting lichens and a ribbony kelp-like weed. it was temperate, cool and clear. visibility was up to fifty kilometres. the sky was blue, and the ridges of mountains stood clear of the lower rainwood fogs like jagged white teeth. six thousand years before, a child called sabbat, daughter of a high pasture herdsman, had lived up in these inhospitable and awesomely beautiful highlands. the spirit of the emperor had filled her, and caused her to abandon her herds and track her way down through the filthy swamps of the rainwoods on the start of a course that would lead her, in fire and steel and ceramite, to distant stars and fabulous victories. one hundred and five years later, she had made the return journey, borne on a palanquin by eight space marines of the adeptus astartes white scars chapter. a saint, even from the moment of her martyrdom. an imperial saint carried in full honour to her birthplace by the emperor's finest warriors. the local star group that now twinkled above her mountains in early evening was named after her. the planet was made sacred in her memory. saint sabbat. the shepherd girl who came down from the mountains of hagia to shepherd the imperium into one of its most punishing and fast-moving crusades. one hundred inhabited systems along the edge of the segmentum pacificus. the sabbat worlds. a pan-planet civilisation. gaunt stood up in the crewbay of his lurching salamander, gazing at the wide, high, clear scenery, the refreshing wind in his face. the sweat of two days in the rainwoods needed blowing away. gaunt remembered slaydo reciting her history to him, back in the early days, as their crusade was being formed. it was shortly after khulen. everyone was talking excitedly about the new crusade. the high lords of terra were going to select slaydo as warmaster because of khulen. the great honour would fall to him. gaunt remembered being called to the study office of the great lord militant commander. he had been just a commissar back then. the study office, aboard the citadel ship borealis, was a circular wooden library of nine levels, lined with fiftytwo million catalogued works. gaunt was one of two thousand and forty officers attending the initial meeting. slaydo, a hunched but powerful man in his late one-forties, limped up to the lectern at the heart of the study office in his flame yellow plate armour. a monumental cheer exploded out across the chamber. slaydo waited for it to die down. let me tell you about the sabbat worlds. zweil grinned and toyed with his beard. mkoll estimated that the shrinehold was still two days away. they raised tents and a strong perimeter. heater units were put to work and chemical fires lit.  no one had thought to bring kindling from the foothills and there was no wood to gather up here. the snow began just before dark, billowing silently from the north. a few minutes before it began, a trooper on watch saw what he thought were contacts on the wide-band auspex. by the time he'd called up gaunt and kleopas, the snow had closed in and the sensor was blind. but for the short time it lasted, it had looked like contacts. cried milo, trying his best not to get caught in the sheets of liquid mud the chimera's tracks were kicking up. shut it down! shouted dorden, exasperated. the engine whined and cut out. quiet returned to the sooka trackway. birds warbled in the gorse thickets and the gnarled vipiriums. greer jumped down from the back hatch and came around the side of the wounded wagon to survey the problem. a fast-moving stream, running directly alongside this stretch of sooka, had undercut the trail and the weight of the chimera had collapsed it leaving the machine raked over at a drunken angle. they'd been on the sooka for over two days now, since corbec's decision to avoid the infardi at nusera, and this was by no means the first time the transport had fallen foul of the track. but it was the first time they hadn't been able to right it again first rime. the chelon trails led up into the holy river headwaters and were for the most part steep. the narrow and sometimes winding trail had taken them up into wooded country where there was no other sign of human life. using sanian's knowledge, they had taken a route that avoided the worst of the lower spurs and gorges where the thick and unwholesome rainwoods flourished. instead, they kept to more open ground where the shelving land was clad in breaks of trees, or small deciduous woods through which the trails rambled. the water was never far away: hectic rills and streams that sometimes shot out over lips in the crags and poured in little silver falls; or the mass of the main water itself, crashing down the sloping land and turning sudden drops into seething cataracts. they gathered rocks and logs from the trail and pieces of slate from the stream bed and derin and daur wedged them in under the track assembly. the team stood clear and greer revved the engines again. the tracks bit. there was a loud crack as a log fractured, and then the machine lurched forward and onto the trail. corbec called. the verghastite had said little since the episode at mukret and had kept to himself. bragg had taken a proprietorial interest in vamberfeld's welfare since the stone skipping. the colonel had asked him to keep an eye on vamberfeld, but to bragg it wasn't an order he was following anymore. through the glade, the land opened out into a wide, banking pasture dotted with wildflowers and heaps of stone. in one corner, against the line of the trees, bragg saw the min of an old lean-to, a herdsman's shelter. he made his way towards it, calling vamberfeld's name. there were many chelon in the pasture, vamberfeld noted. not enough to be worth the drive to market, but the basis of a good herd. the cows were nosing together piles of leaf mulch ready to receive the eggs they would lay before the next new moons. the girl sat cross-legged outside her lean-to, and sprang up warily the moment she saw vamberfeld approaching. the words sounded funny. his tongue was still swollen from the bite he'd put through it in his fit, and he was self-conscious about the way it made his voice sound. she disappeared into her hut. cautiously, he followed. the hut was empty except for old leaf-litter and a few sticks. for a moment, he thought she might be hiding, but there was nowhere to hide, and no loose boards at the rear through which she might have slipped. a couple of old jiddi-sticks lay on the floor inside the door, and on a hook on the wall hung the head-curl of a broken crook. it was very old, and the jagged end where it had snapped was dirty and worn. he realised that the pasture was empty now. there were no lowing chelons, no leaf-nests. the field was growing wild with weeds. gak! look at me! she said suddenly, through a sip of the liquor. her heart-shaped face was suddenly serious. it's alright. it's been a while. i just think it's interesting, the way war is such a leveller. but for war, you and i would never have met. never have spoken. never have even been to each other's sectors of the city. but i wasn't a snob. shaking her head, she held out her glass for a top-up. he poured the bottle. kolea ran out into the square, leaving curth to pull her boots back on. i have to ask� not ours, by any chance. eighteen, nine. gaunt told his driver, the heat of his breath billowing in clouds through the freezing air. as the light tank slid to a halt. more shells whoomed into the snow cover. a munitions chimera trundling slowly towards the rear of the van was hit a glancing blow but continued to struggle on. size? gaunt told the driver. the command salamander moved off, churning through the virgin snow. the three conquerors and the old plasma tank were circling round from the convoy after them. the enemy came into view through the mouth of the pass. four fast-moving steg 4s, the six-wheeled light tanks, fanning out ahead of three at70s and a pair of usurpers. their bright green paint jobs made them stand out starkly against the general white glare. the stegs, their big wheels wrapped in chains, were firing their light 40-mil weapons. hypervelocity tank rounds whistled over the command salamander. gaunt heard the deeper crump of the 105-mil reavers and the even deeper, less frequent thunder of the big usurpers. gaunt yelled to bonin. an at70 made a hit on the say your prayers, but the shot was stopped by the conqueror's heavy armour. the heart of destruction and the lion of pardua fired almost simultaneously. the heart overshot but the lion struck a steg squarely and blew it over in the air. with distance closing, gaunt rose and aimed the tube at the nearest steg. gaunt fired. his rocket went wide. cursed bonin. bonin yelled, slamming the armed rocket into the breach. the sky, mountainside and ground suddenly exchanged places. gaunt found himself tumbling over and over in the snow, winded. a round from the steg had hit the side of the salamander, jerking it over hard. it had righted itself, but not before gaunt had been thrown clear. the wounded salamander chugged to a halt, a sitting duck. the steg galloped up, swivelling its little turret to target the listing salamander. spitting out snow, gaunt got to his feet dazed. he looked about. the rear end of the missile launcher was jutting out of the snow ten metres away from him. he ran over and pulled it out, feverishly tapping the packed snow out of the tube mouth and the venturi. then he shouldered it and took aim, hoping to hell the fall hadn't dented the tube or misaligned the rocket. if it had, the tread-fether would explode in his hands. the speeding steg closed on the salamander for the kill. gaunt could see hark standing up in the crewbay, firing his plasma pistol desperately at the attacking vehicle. gaunt braced and put the crosshairs on the steg. it exploded, kicking up an enormous gust of snow and debris. gaunt hadn't fired. the heart of destruction roared past him in a spray of snow, smoke fuming from its muzzle break. gaunt snapped, running towards the salamander. hark pulled him aboard. gaunt snarled at hark. bonin lay in the footwell, concussed from the impact. zweil smiled through his beard and held up his wizened hands. he declared. cried gaunt. he yelled. the salamander roared away across the snow. gaunt looked out and took stock of the situation. the heart of destruction and the lion of pardua had knocked out the last two stegs, and strife had blown up a reaver. the say your prayers had been hit twice by usurper shells and had come to a standstill. it looked intact, but ominous black smoke was pouring out of its engine louvres. as gaunt's salamander slewed around, strife fired on the nearest usurper and detonated its munitions. shrapnel whickered down over several hundred metres. gaunt braced himself and fired at the nearest at70. the rocket hit its track guard. the battle tank reared up in the drifts and swung its turret around at the speeding salamander. a heavy round blew into the snow behind them. gaunt demanded. hark answered, and gaunt felt the jolt of the rocket slamming home. he took aim at the infardi battle tank and fired. trailing smoke, the missile sped over the snow and hit the tank at the base of its turret. internal explosions blew the hatches out and then burst the barrel off the tank-head. zweil whooped. said gaunt. but the battle was all done.  the lion of pardua and the heart of destruction targetted and killed the remaining usurper pretty much simultaneously and the say your prayers, suddenly coughing back into life, crippled and then killed the last of the reaver at70s. mechanical wrecks, sobbing out plumes of black smoke, marred the sugar-white perfection of the pass. kleopas' conqueror turned hard around in a swirl of snow and bounced back alongside gaunt's salamander. kleopas appeared in the top hatch, holding his field cap in his hands and tugging at it. he pulled something off and tossed it to gaunt. gaunt caught it neatly. kleopas laughed as his machine sped away. through his scope, kolea saw the musters of the enemy as they came down through the fruit glade onto bhavnager. so many machines, so many troops. despite his defences and his careful preparation, they would be overwhelmed. there was a horde of them. sanian shook her head. daur murmured. come the dawn, we might be so buried in snow we can't move again. raglon hissed as gaunt approached. gaunt yelled. a pardus driver hurried forward with a tow-hook, playing out the plasteel-mesh cable. gaunt ordered, and raglon's crew scrambled out onto the snowy trail, dropping to their knees and gasping with relief.  the crews around them now began the job of hauling the empty machine back onto the path. gaunt helped mklane up. they all stopped dead and turned to look out into the darkness. they'd been so busy saving one machine, no one had realised the other had vanished entirely. defeat is the most insidious of our foes. it never comes the way we expect. colonel-commissar ibram gaunt, commander of the tanith first, imperial crusade liberation army. these are my chief officers, major rawne, major kleopas and commissar hark. his face was as weatherbeaten as his colleagues', and his eyes had been replaced by an augmetic visor that made his stare milky and blank, like chronic cataracts. hark hissed. the calm smile never left cortona's face. they stood together on the terrace of the shrinehold's inner wall, looking out across the bright snows towards the gorge. zweil shook his head. why not? you believe in the saint, in her works, in her incorruptible sanctity. your belief in her and all she represents shines from you. it brought you here. so why wouldn't you believe in her deathbed prophecy? yes, i am. it hardly matters. my career's over, my regiment's finished, and there's every chance we won't get out of here alive anyway. zweil's gaze darted back and forth between the two imperial officers in total fascination, hanging on every word. they were high enough now for the snow that sanian had warned them about to become a reality. it was light but persistent, and settled on their clothes and eyelashes. further up the pass, snow clouds choked visibility so badly the great mountains themselves were temporarily invisible, masked out by the storm. they had finally said goodbye to the wounded wagon two hours earlier, abandoning it at a point on the sooka where an old rockslide had long since carried the last of the negotiable track away. loading up with everything they could carry, they had continued on foot. the track was as thin and desolate as the air. to their right towered the sheer south faces of the innermost and highest sacred hills. to their left, a great slope of scree and bare rock arced downwards into the mysterious shadows of gorges and low passes far below. every few steps, one of them caught a loose stone with their toe, and it would skitter and slither away down the decline. the ladder of heaven had been cut by early pilgrims soon after the foundation of the shrinehold six millennia before. they had engineered the work with zealous enthusiasm, seeing it as a sacred task and an art of devotion. a fifty kilometre staircase rising four thousand metres up into the peaks, right to the shrinehold. few used it now, sanian had explained, because the climb was arduous, and even hardy pilgrims preferred the march up the passes. but that softer option wasn't open to them now. sanian led them to the foot of the ladder as the first snows began. it didn't look like much. a narrow, worn series of steps carved into the mountainside itself, eroded by weather and age. lichens clung like rust to the surfaces. each step was about sixteen centimetres high, a comfortable enough pace, and the steps were uniformly two metres deep from front to back, except where they sectioned and turned. the ladder wove up through the rocks and disappeared above them. they started up, greer eagerly hurrying ahead, followed by daur, corbec and dorden, then milo and sanian, nessa, derin and finally vamberfeld and bragg. the main group fell into a rhythm. after about twenty minutes, corbec began to feel oppressed by the sheer monotony of the task. he started to roam with his mind, trying to occupy his thoughts. he considered the distance and altitude, the depth and width of the steps. he did a little sum or two in his head. he called back to sanian. fifty kilometres. troops could cover that in a day, easy. but fifty kilometres of steps� this could take days. hard, painful, bone-numbing days. dorden groaned aloud. corbec concentrated on the steps again. snow was beginning to settle on them. in five or six days, when they reached the shrinehold, gaunt should be virtually all the way back to the doctrinopolis if he was going to make the evac. they were wasting their time. then again, there was no way in creation gaunt's honour guard was going to get down the mountain past that infardi host. chances were he'd use the shrinehold as his base and fight it out from there. they'd have to wait and see. there was no point in going back now. there was nothing to go back for. alone, ibram gaunt pulled back the great old bolt and pushed open the door of the shrinehold's sepulchre. the voices of male esholi filtered out, singing a solemn, harmonious, eight-part chant. cold wind moaned down the monastery's deep airshafts. he didn't know what to expect. he realised he had never imagined coming here. slaydo, the emperor rest him, would have been envious. the room was surprisingly small, and very dark. the walls were lined with black corundum that reflected none of the light from the many rows of burning candles. the air smelled of smoke, and musty dryness, the dust of centuries. he stepped in, closing the door after him. the floor was made of strange, lustrous tiles that shimmered in the candlelight and made an odd, plastic sound as he walked on them. he realised they were cut and polished sections of chelon shell, pearlescent, with a brown stain of time. to either side of where he stood were alcove bays in the corundum.  in each glowed a life-size hologram of a white scars space marine, power blades raised in salutes of mournful triumph. gaunt walked forward. directly ahead of him was the reliquary altar. plated with more polished chelon shell, it shone with ethereal luminescence. inlaid on its raised front was a beautiful mosaic of coloured shell pieces depicting the sabbat worlds. gaunt had no doubt it was cartographically precise. behind the altar rose a huge, domed cover that overhung the altar block like a cowl. it was fashioned from a single chelon shell, a shell that had come from an incredibly massive animal, far larger than anything gaunt had seen on hagia. beneath it, behind the altar, lay the reliquary itself, a candlelit cavern under the shell. at the front were two hardwood stands with open lids in which, behind glass, lay original manuscripts of the gospels. gaunt realised his heart was beating fast. the place was having an extraordinary effect on him. he moved past the gospel stands. to his left stood a casket on which lay various relics half-wrapped in satin. there was a drinking bowl, a quill pen, a jiddi-stick worn black with age, and several other fragments he couldn't identify. to his right, on top of another, matching casket, lay the saint's imperator armour, painted blue and white. it showed the marks of ancient damage, blackened holes and grooves, jagged dents where the paint had been scraped off. the marks of the nine martyring wounds. there was something odd about it. gaunt realised it was� small. it had been purpose-built for a body smaller than the average male space marine. ahead of him, at the very rear of the shell dome, lay the holy reliquary, a bier covered in a glass casket. saint sabbat lay within. she had wanted no stasis field or power suspension, but still she was intact after six thousand years. her features had sunk, her flesh had desiccated, and her skin was dark and polished. around her skull there were traces of fine hair. gaunt could see the rings on her mummified fingers, the medallion of the imperial eagle clasped in her hands across her bosom. the blue of her gown had almost entirely faded, and the dry husks of ancient flowers lay around her on the velvet padding of the bier. gaunt didn't know what to do. zweil nodded and patted gaunt on the arm. well, do you? this last week, you've not been the man i started serving under. the drinking. the rages. the foul, foul fething moods. you failed. you failed badly. at the doctrinopolis, you fethed up good and proper. you've been a wreck ever since. clean up. work it out. show us all. show us this isn't just spite and bile and frustration coming out of you because you fethed up and they caught you for it. show us you're not just a drunken wreck going down fast and bitterly trying to take everything and everyone with you. it's over for you, any way you cut it but it isn't for us. if we go along with you, the lord general will have us all court-martialled and shot. at the victory feast, he brought his officers together. forty-eight of us, the chosen men. we caroused and celebrated. we all got a little drunk, slaydo included. then he� he became solemn, that bitter sadness that afflicts some men when they are at their worse for drink. we asked him what was wrong, and he said he was afraid. we laughed! great warmaster slaydo, afraid? he got to his feet, unsteady. he was one hundred and fifty years old by then, and those years had not been kind. he told us he was afraid of dying before finishing his work. afraid of not living long enough to oversee the full and final liberation of the beati's worlds. it was his one, consuming ambition, and he was afraid he would not achieve it. gaunt held out his right hand, palm open. rawne nodded slowly. gaunt walked into the centre of the crowded anteroom, declined a drink offered to him by an esholi, and cleared his throat. there was a murmur. lieutenant pauk voice was full of alarm. kleopas nodded urgently at his junior officer's words. in terms of necessity alone, i'd say the colonel-commissar was making a sound decision. cried captain marchese, commander of the conqueror p48j. several officers, ghosts among them, applauded marchese's words. squealed elthan. hark stepped forward. hark looked round at the silent room and then his gaze returned to gaunt. after the disaster at the citadel, he would have had you drummed out on the spot. but i knew damn well you were worth more than that. i suggested a final mission, this honour guard.  i thought it might give you a chance to redeem yourself, or at least finish your career on a note of respectability. i even thought it might give lugo time to reconsider and change his mind. a successful salvation of the shrineworld relics from under the nose of an overwhelming enemy force could even be turned into a famous victory with the right spin. hark sighed and straightened the front of his waistcoat. rawne rose slowly. he walked across the packed room to gaunt and then stood at his side, facing hark. follow my instructions and relieve gaunt of his weapons now or i'll have you up on charges. hark looked around. a dozen sidearms were pointing at him, aimed by ghost officers and a few pardus, including leguin and kleopas. hark holstered his weapon. out in the blizzarding night, at waymark 00.02 at the head of the pass, scout-trooper bonin and troopers larkin and lillo were dug into an ice bunker. they had a chemical heater puffing away in the base of the dug-out, but it was still bitterly cold. bonin was watching the portable auspex unit while larkin hunted the flurrying darkness with the night scope of his long-las. illuminated in ghostly green, he could see blurs of light on the pass below. hundreds of lights were moving up the precipitous track towards them. headlamps glaring in the falling snow. bright yellow sigils wobbled around the contour lines of the holo-map. � warmaster slaydo, from a treatise on the nature of warfare when the snowing stopped just before dawn, the infardi advance guard began their first assault up the top of the pass. a bombardment was launched by their reserve tanks and self-propelled guns, but most of it fell short of the shrinehold walls. six stegs and eight reavers churned through the snow towards the promontory, and a hurrying line of four hundred troops followed them. they were met by the pardus armour and the dug-in sections of the tanith first-and-only. hull-down, grey venger picked off the first four armour units before they were even clear of the spur. their burning carcasses dirtied the snow-field with blackened debris and fire. heavy weapon emplacements opened up to meet the infantry. in a quarter of an hour, the white slopes were scattered with green-robed dead. a steg and an at70 pushed in past the outer defence, behind grey venger's field of fire. they were met and destroyed by kleopas' heart of destruction and marchese's p48j. the infardi fell back. gaunt strode into the tent where ghost troopers were guarding the infardi officer taken prisoner at bhavnager. the wretch was shivering and broken. the infardi rose, facing gaunt, and spat in his face. dorden exclaimed, vapour gusting from his lips, as he tried to pull corbec to his feet. daur called back to them. he and derin were about forty steps above them, silhouetted against the bright white sky. they heard a rolling roar that wasn't the constant wind. a buffeting, thunderous drone, mixed over what they slowly realised were the voices of thousands of howling, chanting men. corbec got up. he wanted to just lie down and die. he couldn't feel his feet anymore. but he got up and leaned against dorden. a few steps behind them, the others had caught up, all except greer who was now lagging a long, long way behind. bragg and nessa sat down in the snow to catch their breaths. vamberfeld stood panting with his eyes closed. milo looked at sanian, whose weary face was clouded by what he supposed to be grief. it wasn't. it was anger. gaunt cried to the fireteam at his heels, and they pushed out in assault tackling the infardi, sometimes hand to hand. gaunt's bolt pistol fired shot after shot, and the power sword of heironymo sondar whispered in his fist. two ghosts beside him were cut down. caffran! gaunt yelled. caffran hurled a tube-charge, spinning it end over end. it bounced in the thick snowpack right at the infardi officer's feet and went off brightly. the blasts didn't hurt the ershul officer, but it effectively blew the ground out from under him and he fell, his refractor shield hissing in the snow. gaunt was immediately on him, yelling out, stabbing down two-handed with his power blade. criid, beltayn and adare were right at his heels, gunning down the ershul-lord's bodyguard. power sword met refractor shield. the shield was a model manufactured by chaos-polluted mechanicus factories on the occupied forgeworld ermune. it was powerful and effective. the power sword was so old, no one knew its original place of manufacture. it popped the shield like a needle lancing a blister. the fizzling cloak of energy vanished and gaunt's sword blade plunged on, impaling the screaming infardi revealed inside. gaunt wrenched the sword out and got up. the infardi nearby, those who hadn't yet been dropped by his ghosts, backed off and ran in fear.  by killing the officer in front of their eyes, he'd put a chink in their insane confidence. but it was a tiny detail of triumph in a much greater battle-storm. major rawne, commanding units nearer to the main gate, could see no respite in the onslaught. the infardi were throwing themselves at his position as fast as his troops in the snow-trenches and on the wall parapet could fire on them. a row of self-propelled guns was working up behind the enemy infantry, and their munitions now came whistling down, throwing up great bursts of ice and fire. two shells dropped inside the wall and one hit the wall itself, blowing out a ten-metre chunk. rawne saw the grey venger advancing over the snow, streaking titanic stripes of laser fire at the usurper guns. one was hit and sent up a fiery mushroom cloud. rocket grenades slapped and banged off the venger's hull. the lion of pardua smashed directly through a faltering pack of infardi troopers, dozer blade lowered, fighting to get a shot at the heavy gun units too. a tank round, coming from emperor alone knew where, destroyed its starboard tracks and it lurched to a stop. the shrieking infardi were all over it, mobbing the hull, their green figures swarming across the crippled tank. rawne tried to direct some of his troop fire to assist the conqueror, but the range was bad and they were too boxed in. tank hatches were shot or blasted open, and the mob of infardi dragged the lion's crew out screaming. troopers cuu and tokar moved up beside the prone banda and resumed firing. the barrel of larkin's long-las had failed. he unscrewed the flash suppressor and then twisted and pulled out the long, mined barrel. larkin was so practiced at this task he could swap the xc 52/3 strengthened barrels in less than a minute. but his bag of spares was empty. larkin reached in and pulled out a roll of vizzy-cloth. there were three xc 52/3s wrapped in it. larkin locked one into place, checked the line, and rescrewed his suppressor. yeah, larkin blew on his mittened hands and began firing again. he hissed at banda. only two less than him. feth , she was good. then again, who wouldn't score when they had this many damned targets to fire at? rawne got a fireteam forward as far as the cover provided by one of their own burning chimeras. lillo, gutes, cocoer and baen dropped into the filthy snow beside him, firing through the raging smoke that boiled out of the machine. a moment later, luhan, filain, caill and mazzedo moved up close and provided decent crossfire under feygor's command. rawne waved a third team � orul, sangul, dorro, raess and muril � round to the far side of the chimera. they were reaching position when an infardi counter-push hit. two rounds from an at70 erupted like small volcanoes in their midst. filain and mazzedo were obliterated instantly. cocoer was gashed by flying metal and fell screaming. steam rose from his hot blood in the chill air. gutes and baen ran forward to drag the bawling, bloody tanith into cover, but gutes was immediately hit in the leg by a las-round. baen turned in surprise and took two hits in the lower back. his arms lurched up and he fell on his face. infardi troops rushed in from the left, weapons blazing. in the savage short-range firelight that followed, first oral and then sangul were killed by massive torso injuries. dorro managed to get baen and cocoer into cover and then he was hit in the jaw with such destructive force his head was virtually twisted off. rawne found himself pinned with luhan, lillo, feygor and caill, firing in support of raess and muril who were closer to the trio of wounded ghosts. the blackened wreckage of a munitorium troop track fifty metres ahead splintered and rolled as something big pushed it aside. for a moment rawne felt relief, sure it was one of the pardus conquerors. but it wasn't. lillo wailed. the steg fired and the whooping shell slammed through the dead chimera. there was a chilling wail from behind rawne's position. part animal shriek, part pneumatic hiss, a sound that swooped from high pitch to low. the output of a powerful beam weapon ripped into the front of the steg and a rash of pressurised flame blew out the side panels. commissar hark yelled to rawne and his soldiers as he fired again into the midst of a charging infardi platoon. they half carried and half dragged gutes, cocoer and baen back the twenty metres to the nearest snow-work cover. but he couldn't. looking out at the forces that swept in to overran and slaughter them, there was no denying it. the cold-blooded major was right. in the very heaviest part of the battle, gaunt knew it too. troopers fell all around him. he saw caffran, wounded in the leg, being dragged to cover by criid. he saw adare hit twice, convulse and drop. he saw two verghastite ghosts thrown into the air by a shell burst he almost fell over the stiffening corpse of trooper brehl, the blood spats from his wounds frozen like gemstones. a las-round hit gaunt in the left arm and spun him a little. something happened to the sky. it changed abruptly from frozen chalk-white to fulminous yellow, swirling with cloud patterns. a sudden, almost hot wind surged up the gorge. banda murmured. chaos madness. silent auroras of purple and scarlet rippled across the sky. crimson blooms swirled out and stained the sky like ink spots in water. lightning strikes, searing violet-white, sizzled and cracked down, accompanied by thunderclaps so loud they shook the mountain. the savage fighting foundered and ceased.  beneath the alien deluge, the infardi fled back down to the pass, leaving their wounded and their crippled machines behind them. the mass exodus was so sudden, they had cleared the approach fields of the shrinehold in less than ten minutes. the imperials cowered in terror beneath the twisting lightshow. vehicle engines stalled. vox signals went berserk in whoops of interference and swarms of static. many troopers wrenched their microbead ear-plugs out, wincing. vox-officer raglon's ears were bleeding by the time he'd managed to pull off his headset. wild static charge filled the air, crackling off weapons, making hair stand on end. greenish corposant and ball lightning wriggled and flared around the eaves and roofs of the shrinehold. in the face of final defeat, something had saved gaunt's honour guard, or at least allowed it a temporary reprieve. ironically, that something was chaos. lesp saluted, collected up his medicae kit and hurried out. gaunt looked round at the elderly high priest. a typical hark-esque no-warning appearance. you've fought well all the way along. you've tried to do your duty, even if i haven't liked it. gaunt held out his hand and hark shook it. the doors to the hall swung open and cold air billowed in, bringing with it major kleopas, captain leguin, captain marchese and the ghost officers soric, mkoll, bray, meryn, theiss and obel. they stomped their boots and brushed flakes from their sleeves. gaunt nodded. before nightfall would be my guess, captain. asked soric. the men laughed. good , there was some damn morale left yet. gaunt ran out down the steps, through the snow lying between the inner and outer walls, towards the gate. rawne and a section of men were just coming in, bringing with them ten haggard, stumbling figures, caked in dirt and rime, half-starved and weary. gaunt's eyes widened. he came to a halt. trooper derin. try again bragg. the verghastite ghosts vamberfeld and nessa. captain daur, supporting a halfdead pardus officer gaunt didn't know. dorden� great god-emperor! dorden! and milo, emperor protect him, carrying a hagian girl in his arms. and there, at the head of them, colonel colm corbec. corbec whispered, and pitched over into the snow. � warmaster kiodrus, from the path to the nine wounds: a history of service with the saint the night of the sixteenth day fell, but it was not proper night. the surging maelstrom of the warp storm lit the sky above the shrinehold with pulses and cyclones of kaleidoscopic light and electromagnetic spectres. the snows had ceased, and under the silent, flickering glare, the embattled imperials stood watch at battle-readiness, gazing at the reflections of the rapidly fluctuating colour patterns on the snowfield and the ice of the sacred hills. it was the stillest time, almost tranquil. vivid colour roiled and swelled, broke and ebbed, all across the heavens. barely a breeze stirred. perhaps as a result of the warp-eddies, the temperature had risen to just above zero. in an anteroom in the monastery, ayatani carefully lit the oil lamps and then left without a word. gaunt put his cap and gloves on a side table. he'd poured himself a glass of sacra, but realised he didn't really want it. he offered it to rawne, who shook his head, and then to dorden, who took it and sipped it. the tanith chief medic sat near the central fire pit. colm sipped his broth, put it down, and pulled a box of cigars from his hip pouch. he offered them around. zweil exploded in a coughing fit. don't look at me like that either of you. i know how mad it sounds. that's how i felt when colm told it to me. but answer me this� what in the name of the good god-emperor would make an old man like me come all this way too? eh? it almost killed me. the fething ladder of heaven! it nearly killed all of us. but none of us are mad. none of us. spat dorden. rawne shrugged and sat. the mild old medic had never spoken to him like that before. oh, very probably. if it makes it easier for you, we can pretend i slogged three hundred fething kilometres just because i wanted to be with you at the last stand of the ghosts. daur sat over in the corner and so far he'd said nothing. the cold and fatigue of his hard journey had played hell with his wound-weakened state. rawne exclaimed. asked gaunt steadily. dorden nodded. then he went along willingly, just like that. a motivation i can believe. zweil asked, blowing casual but perfect smoke rings. oh good. i'd hate to be the last to know. save it, colm. tell me this� if i believe this miraculous story one millimetre� what happens now? corbec looked at dorden, who shrugged. daur put his head in his hands. rawne chuckled. he stubbed out his cigar butt in a saucer. what's your word for it�? pilgrims! they're bloody pilgrims! they have come all this way in the name of the hallowed beati! gaunt ran his splayed hands back though his cropped blond hair. sir? praise you to the saint brin. outside, the warp storm blistered across the night sky. gaunt stopped dead and they slammed into him from behind. said gaunt. stop it! cried gaunt. whispered bragg, pushing open the heavy, red door of the sepulchre. he wasn't sure where he was, but it looked a feth of a lot like a place he shouldn't be. the chamber was dark, the air was smoky and the floor was squeaky. bragg edged across the shiny tiles carefully. they looked valuable. too valuable for his big boots. scary holos of space marines loomed out of alcoves in the black walls. same as you, tanith. the other voice said. don't. not in here, vamberfeld thought. please not in here. his hand was starting to shake. he got up and came out of the reliquary. greer was standing inside the big red door, which he'd closed behind him. he looked sick and desperate and twitchy. his skin was haggard and blotchy from the ordeal they'd all been through. he was pointing a guard-issue autopistol at bragg. the moment vamberfeld appeared, greer flicked the muzzle to cover him as well. the gold! the damn gold! spat greer, swinging the gun back to cover the verghastite. screamed greer, aiming the gun at vamberfeld. his hand was shaking so much. so hard. trying to make it stop, he pushed it into his pocket. bragg lunged at greer, grappling frantically at his weapon. the pistol discharged. bragg raged in horror. his massive left fist crashed into greer's face, hurling the pardus back across the sepulchre with blood spurting from his broken nose and teeth. the gun fired again twice, sending one bullet through bragg's right thigh and the other explosively through the front of the chelonshell altar in a spray of lustrous shards. bragg lunged at greer again, big hands clawing. the pardus sergeant's first shot didn't even slow bragg down, even though it went right through his torso. neither did the second. the third finally brought bragg down, hard on his face, at greer's feet. greer snarled contemptuously at the fallen men, trying to staunch the blood pouring out of his smashed face. the verghastite lay on the floor beside bragg, face up, staring at the roof shadows high above through sightless eyes. bragg was face down. a wide and spreading lake of blood seeped out across the ancient, precious tiles from each of them. the pardus sergeant strode in towards the sepulchre. shooting! from the sepulchre bellowed corbec, gazing at the bodies and the blood. cried rawne, his laspistol already drawn. in the reliquary itself, greer dived for cover behind the altar. he'd overturned the hardwood relic casket in his frantic search, spilling the ancient pieces across the floor. the glass covers over the gospel stands were smashed. the venerated imperator armour was half-slumped off its palanquin. greer! greer! back the hell off cried daur. greer! you'll blow everything! murmured rawne through gritted teeth. dorden was hastily dragging him back into the cover of the doorway. the bullet had punched through rawne's forearm. daur yelled, trying to edge forward. greer rose from behind the altar, his gun in his hand. gaunt righted the relic casket and began putting the scattered fragments back reverently.  he was trying to keep compression on bragg's most serious injury. the sound of running footsteps came from outside. milo and sanian burst in through the doorway and stopped dead. he wasn't convinced. in the reliquary, gaunt seemed almost beside himself with agony as he tried to set things right. asked rawne sharply, looking around. the candles flickered and went out all at once. pale , undersea light washed through the ancient tomb, green and cold. the holograms of the adeptus astartes dissolved and vanished, and in their place columns of bright white hololithic light extended from floor to ceiling. the black stone walls sweated and a pattern of previously invisible geometric blue bars glowed into life out of the stone, all the way around the chamber. everything shook with the deep, ultrasonic growl. dorden nodded. � saint sabbat, epistles the ershul's final assault began at two o'clock on the morning of the seventeenth day. in the silence of a snow-less, clear night, under the spasming auroras of the warp storm, they committed their entire strength to the attack on the shrinehold. support columns of reinforcements had been pushing up the pass all day and into the night. the ershul were legion-strength. nine thousand devotee-warriors. five hundred and seventy armoured machines. just under two thousand able-bodied imperial troops defended the shrinehold, supported by the last four conquerors, one executioner, one destroyer, and a handful of chimeras, salamanders and hydra batteries. all they had on their side was the strategic strength of their walled position and the comparative narrowness of the approach across the promontory. the staggering power of the ershul bombardment hammered down onto the imperial lines. the honour guard did not fire back. they were so low on ammunition and shells they had to wait to pick their targets. the ershul host advanced towards them. standing on the inner wall, gaunt surveyed their approaching doom through his scope. even by his best estimate, they would be able to hold out for no more than twenty or thirty minutes. he turned and looked at rawne and hark. rawne's arm was thickly bandaged. the officers strode away down the wall steps together. walking towards their deaths, gaunt thought, taking one last look at the major and the commissar. and i should be there with them. he turned and hurried back to the sepulchre where the others were waiting. ayatani-ayt cortona was declaring yet again, his principal clerics gathered around him. cried cortona. asked one of the ayatani. in the event of a true catastrophe, like this influx of the warp. it presumes you soldiers are more holy than the sacred brotherhood! you hear that? the forces of chaos are at the gates! we have a chance to use the technology the saint has left for us. he gestured to the glowing bars of light in the shrine's corundum walls, lights that had not yet faded. some trigger-icon. he rose from his stool and took the silver trinket from his pocket. soric yelled above the roar of explosions. infardi shells had torn the gate and the front part of the inner wall away. gaunt, corbec, milo, sanian and daur approached the back gate of the outer shrinehold wall. the din of battle behind them was deafening. they readied their weapons. sanian hefted up her lasrifle. he never finished his sentence. rawne yelled. the ershul or whatever their fething name was were all over their positions now. the pillar seemed a hundred kilometres away across the snow, gleaming at the very end of the jagged promontory. corbec yelped as a las-round hit his leg and brought him down. sanian turned and fired her gun on full auto, ripping into the enemy. ban! daur held the silver trinket out, clasped in his bloody fingers. lesp obeyed. it was futile, dorden knew. dorden yelled over as he worked. dorden cried. through the prismatic scope of his sight, leguin saw captain marchese's p48j blow out in a swirl of sparks. barely a second later, the same at70 that had killed marchese and his crew put a shell through the side of the grey venger. leguin's layer and loader were both disintegrated. the destroyer lurched and stopped dead, its turbines failing for the very last time. fire swirled through the compartment, up under leguin's feet. his hair was singed. he tried the hatch above him. it was jammed shut. resignedly, captain leguin sat back in his command chair and waited for the end. scout sergeant mkoll yelled down at him, his arms outstretched. mkoll and leguin had got twenty metres from the grey venger when it exploded and flattened them both. too many! too many! cried larkin, firing through his last remaining barrel. sure as sure. she took the silver icon. three ershul troopers were just a few metres away. sanian turned to fire, the unfamiliar lasrifle awkward in her hands. the closest ershul aimed his weapon to kill her. she threw herself down in desperation. pin-point las-fire toppled her would-be killer and the two ershul behind him. the icon! milo called, looking around. sanian replied, groping about in the snow as blisteringly intense shots fell around them. major kleopas was smiling. he didn't need his augmetic implant to see it. the view through the scope was clear. the last round fired from the heart of destruction had destroyed a reaver in a bloom of fire. but it was the last round. the last round ever. his valiant crew was dead. flames filled his turret basket, igniting his clothes. he couldn't move to escape. the ghosts around him were falling back in panic in the face of the overwhelming host. blood from a head wound was running down his cheek and he'd lost his cap. an ershul officer, another swirling ball of shield energy, loomed ahead of him. he'd killed three of its kind so far. look! �colm corbec, at hagia from deep inside its planetary core, obeying ancient instructions, the mechanisms of the saint came alive. vast psychic amplifiers woke and broadcast their signal. for just an instant. an instant enough to send abject fear into the souls of the chaos spawn infesting the planet. an instant enough to cremate the minds of ershul hosts choking up across the promontory. an instant enough to blow back the warp storm with such force that the advancing fleet was tumbled aside. an instant enough to show tolin dorden his smiling son again, to show colm corbec one last glimpse of his father, to show ban daur a final vision of the old woman with the shockingly white hair in the refugee crowd. to show trooper niceg vamberfeld the hard, penetrating eyes of the chelon herdsgirl in the last moment of his life. outside the shrinehold, under a cold, blue sky, ibram gaunt limped out, and down a churned-up mass of snow and stone that used to be steps. he was clad in full dress uniform. the remnants of the convoy waited below. beyond them, littered across the snows of the promontory, lay the fused and charred skeletons of nine thousand chaos-touched humans and the blackened wrecks of over five hundred war machines. gaunt paused and looked back along the promontory at the lonely post tomb the tempelum ayatani had erected in the snow and rock beside the corundum pillar of the eternal watch fire. hark relayed down the line. gaunt thought of slaydo for a moment and the old blood pact. he touched the scar on his palm. he cried, making a sweeping gesture with his hand. the units began to rumble forward, under a spotless sky of frozen blue, down towards the head of the pass.    a warhammer 40,000 novel straight silver gaunt's ghosts - 06 it is the 41st millennium. for more than a hundred centuries the emperor has sat immobile on the golden throne of earth. he is the master of mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. he is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the dark age of technology. he is the carrion lord of the imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die. yet even in his deathless state, the emperor continues his eternal vigilance. mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the emperor's will. vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. greatest amongst his soldiers are the adeptus astartes, the space marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. their comrades in arms are legion: the imperial guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant inquisition and the tech-priests of the adeptus mechanicus to name only a few. but for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse. to be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. it is to live in the cruellest and most bloody regime imaginable. these are the tales of those times. forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. � leonid fep krefuel, high sezar of aexegary brunsgatte towered around him like a badly-ordered dream. he was weary from the long train journey and, as he had moved westward, the weather had become increasingly poor and wet, so now the pin in his femur ached rheumatically. he had tried to distract himself by reviewing the despatches once again, but it was too dark in the back of the limousine. instead, he sat back, hands clasped across his belly, and watched the city as it passed. dusk was closing, and the lamps along the strasseways were beginning to glow amber under their frosted-glass hoods. in twenty minutes, they would be little stars of pearl-white light. the rain was coming down. to the south, it made dark, blurry sheets under the clouds that frothed above the commercial district and the brunsgatte docks. the limousine, shiny black like a dress uniform shoe, was an old ampara furioso vitesse, as solidly built as a leman russ. on either side of the silver leaping-behj ornament above the car's snarling chrome grille, a pennant fluttered. the blue and gold state flag to the left; the gold, white and magenta colours of the aexe alliance to the right. he could barely hear the eight litre engine, such was the thickness of the bodywork and the upholstery, but the stroking windshield wipers squealed every ten seconds like fingernails down a blackboard. the car crossed congressplatz, passed under the shadow of sezar's gate, where slopes of red wreaths were piled up, and ran the length of the colonnade of fishers to trimercy. squeak, squeak, squeak, stroked the wipers. they stopped at the lights at trimercy, and the southerly flow of traffic passed before them. the outriders each put a boot down to steady their bikes. the limousine's climate control seemed to be circulating nothing but warm exhaust fumes. he leaned forward and fiddled with the dial, to no appreciable effect. the driver lowered the lacquered communicating screen. a junior military aide held the limousine door for him. in the days of the great sezars, generals had entered brunsgatte from the fortress gate, carried in pomp on jewelled warcarts pulled by striding struthids. those times were long gone, but protocol demanded that he transferred from the car to a warcart for the final, formal approach. a squadron of hussars had the warcart waiting. the struthids, some of the last of that dwindling species, were huge, proud beasts with massive, polished beaks and thick plumage, standing twenty hands high. he thought of the scabby, thin mounts the front-line cavalry were forced to make do with. he stepped up onto the warcart's backplate, his attach� case tucked under his arm, and the hussar chief lashed the struthids forward. their trimmed black claws drew sparks from the wet cobbles as they began to canter. the fighting birds drew the warcart in under the entry arch of mons sezari and drew up at the west porch of the palace, a long aisle of electric lamps under a stained glass roof. officers of the bande sezari were waiting in full dress uniform, struthid plumes in their shakos. they wore voluminous pantaloons of green silk, with gold chains linking the wide hips to their wrists, so that when they saluted, they seemed to spread wide green wings in his honour. he dismounted, paid the driver his ritual scuto, and walked up the long blue carpet into the porch. the attach� case swung in his hand. sire kido fep soten, the high sezar's chamberlain, was waiting for him under the glass portico. soten parted the black velvet of his ermine-trimmed robes and made the aquila salute across his chest. golke wanted to ask who the men were, but he could tell the high sezar of aexegary was in one of his businesslike moods. he'd been the same when they'd met the week before the push on jepel and seiberq. he's preparing to give me instructions he knows i won't like , golke thought. god help us, not another seiberq. golke set down his drink. golke's fingers were shaking as he unbuckled the attach� case and slid the duplicate copies of the report out. both were sleeved in blue covers and closed with gold ribbons. he passed one to his master, who took it and slit the ribbon with the behj-claw he wore on a signet ring. no, my lord. forty years, count. forty years of this. forty years of waste and cost and stagnation. there are boy soldiers on the front these days whose grandfathers died in the first phases, when we stood against shadik alone. the sezar asked quietly. count golke, please. i'm not blaming you for those forty years. i praise your efforts, the sterling work you have undertaken since you took over as commander-in-chief. the sezar raised a hand.  he felt a hide giddy. the sezar laughed, loudly. it was forced, golke could sense. � he'll want authority, and space to cohere his forces. he and his senior staff need a liaison, someone who can help to acclimatize them and clasp them into our war effort efficiently. i trust you, golke. the sezar snorted. one up the line to the naeme � savil fep lyntor-sewq, supreme commander, aexe alliance forces, on reviewing casualty lists the hulking lift-carriers had dispersed them onto lush green paddocks near a place they had been told was called bransgatte. they could see the city skyline in the distance, through leafy woodland and the low-rise roofs of outer boroughs. some time that morning it had rained, but now the day was warm and clear and felt like spring. everything had come off in the paddocks: infantry, heavy support, munitions, supplies, even the disorderly, unofficial ranks of camp followers. processions of big, dirty-sided trucks had begun to lurch onto the grass to gather them all up and transport them to the railhead. two kilometres away, over the woodland, the drop-ships of the krassian sixth were visible in the air, gliding down onto their own assembly points. trooper caffran of the tanith first-and-only wandered slowly away from the landing zone, where the grass was bent over by jetwash, and stood by a hedge, overlooking the belt of woods. he sort of liked this place already. there were trees. there was greenery. caffran, first name dermon, was twenty-four standard years old. he was short but well-made, with a blue dragon tattooed on his temple. he had been born and bred on tanith, a forest world that no longer existed. caffran was an imperial guardsman � a highly effective one, according to his formal record. he wore the standard issue kit of a tanith soldier: cross-laced black boots, black fatigue trousers and blouse over standard issue vest and shorts, with webbing � which supported his field pouches and a plump musette bag � and lightweight, matt-grey cloth armour. a tight, black buckle-under helmet made of ceramite swung from his waist belt beside his warknife. a heavy pack was slung from his back. his standard pattern mark iii lasrifle, its stock and furniture made of nalwood, as were all tanith-stamped lasguns, hung on a fylon sling over his shoulder. caffran could smell rain and beech-mast on the air, the wet odours of a woodland floor. just for a second, the smell was unbearably evocative. his heart struggled to accommodate the feelings. he glanced back to see if he was missed, but there already seemed some delay in loading the regiment onto the trucks. engines idled and grumbled, and an occasional wheel spun in the muddy grass that the convoy was quickly chewing up. local military had pegged out assembly points on the paddock with metal tent stakes and twine, but seeing the wait, few of the tanith had stayed in their sections. some sat on the grass. a few dropped their packs and started kicking a ball around. stewards in long, tan greatcoats hurried about, shouting instructions, directing trucks and trying to gather guardsmen together as if they were escaped poultry. at the end of the hedge, caffran found a brick-paved path that ran away under an avenue of grey-barked trees. these paddocks were clearly a municipal park, he realised, turned into a makeshift landing zone. there were benches facing the path, and he sat down on one in damp shade of the avenue trees. it was nice, he thought. sure, the trees had none of the grandeur of tanith trees, but still. he wondered how tona was doing. she was his girl, though she was a fellow trooper too. tona had come in on a different carrier because they were in different squads now. sergeant criid. it still made him chuckle. another first for the first-and-only. between every other tree in the avenue, there was a large, smooth cube of white stone. each had a faded oblong patch on the side facing the path. caffran wondered what they were. markers of some sort, maybe. he heard someone coming up behind him and turned.  it was commissar hark, the regiment's political officer. caffran grabbed up his pack hurriedly and stood, but hark waved him down with a relaxed hand. sometimes hark could be a bastard disciplinarian, but only when it mattered, and it clearly didn't matter now. he gave the bench a quick brush with his gloved hand and sat down next to caffran, curtseying the tails of his stormcoat over his thighs so he could cross his legs. viktor hark was a sturdy man, strong but fleshy from years of good living. his eyes were slightly hooded and his clean shaven cheeks slabby. he took off his commissariate cap and fiddled with the lining, revealing thick, cropped black hair on a skull that rose like the round tip of bullet from his broad neck. forty fething years. you're a guest of a nation called aexegary, the chief amongst seven nation states that are at war with the republic of shadik. caffran nodded. he didn't really care much, but it wasn't often he got to have a conversation with hark. hark shrugged. it's everyone else i'd worry about. hark sniggered and put his cap back on. my appraisal precisely. still, it's going to be interesting. three new sergeants to test in the field. he found derin and costin leaning against a vacant plinth smoking lho-sticks. it all seemed clear. caffran was about to turn back himself when he spotted a lone figure right down at the edge of the adjoining paddock, lurking under a small stand of trees. as he jogged closer, he could see who it was: larkin. the regiment's master sniper was so lost in his own thoughts, he didn't hear caffran approach. he seemed to be listening to the rustle of the breeze through the branches above him. his kit and his bagged long-las were piled up on the grass beside him. caffran slowed his pace to a walk. larkin had never been the most stable of the tanith, but he'd become particularly withdrawn and distant since bragg's death. everyone had been fond of try again bragg. it was hard not to be. genial and good-natured, almost gentle, he'd used his famous size and strength to great effect as a heavy weapons specialist� never mind his terrible aim, which had earned him the nickname. bragg had fallen to enemy fire at ouranberg and everyone missed him. he'd seemed to be one of the regiment's permanent features, immovable, like bedrock. his death had robbed them all of something. confidence perhaps. even the most gung-ho ghosts had stopped believing they would live forever. bragg had been larkin's closest friend. they'd been a double art, the wiry sniper and the giant gunner, like clarco and clop, the downs in the imperial mystery plays. larkin had taken the big man's death hardest of all, probably, caffran guessed, because larkin hadn't been there. he said, backing off, his hands raised. it seemed to take a moment for larkin to recognise caffran. sergeant bray! buzzel watched the colonel-commissar curiously. apparently, he was quite a war hero, so they said. tall, imposing in his black leather stormcoat and commissariate cap, with a face like� like his name. narrow, sculptural, noble. buzzel reflected sourly that he didn't know what a war hero was meant to look like. sixteen years of frontline service and he'd never met one. he liked gaunt's manner. a handsome young tanith captain rushing past stopped to salute gaunt. yes sir. trying to find grell's platoon. they should be aboard c train already, but they've been lost in the mix. surgeon curth? what's the problem? if i may, sir� the medical supplies would have been loaded onto train e along with consumables. aexegarian efficiency is a step ahead of you. gaunt! gaunt! gaunt made a mock bow, doffed his cap to them and then stood again, clapping back at them. there were cheers. replied a soldier with bulky augmetic optical implants. a lad appeared in the crowded wagon doorway, the youngest tanith buzzel had yet seen. the boy nodded and, after a few moments, a wailing, haunting note rose up above the frenetic activity. three tracks away, colm corbec, colonel and second officer of the tanith regiment, heard the pipes as he slammed the wagon's side-door shut and dropped the latch. muril was a verghastite, one of a host of men and women recruited from the city of vervunhive to bolster the original tanith strength. the divided loyalties and cultural differences of the two sides � tanith and verghast � had taken a long time to gel, but now they seemed to be pulling together as one fluid unit and for that corbec was grateful. they'd fought well together, mixed well, complemented each other's strengths, but as far as corbec was concerned, the real breakthrough had come when they'd started using each other's curse words. train e pulled out, rattling as it hunted over the multiple points and gained speed. major elim rawne, third officer of the regiment under gaunt and corbec, sat back in the first troop wagon and accepted a lho-stick from his adjutant, feygor. feygor was a vicious whip of a man, tall and thin, who had allied himself to rawne right from the off. some said they had a murky history that went back to their days on tanith. they were alike. rawne was handsome, in the way that weapons and snakes are handsome. slim but well-built, rawne had a fine profile and eyes that, as corbec put it, could charm the drawers off a sororitas nun. rawne hated gaunt. it was that simple. he hated him for a number of things, but foremost he hated him for letting the tanith homeworld die. but it was an old hatred, and it had become feeble with neglect. these days, he tolerated gaunt. even so, most of the troops thought rawne was the nastiest piece of work the tanith first could offer. they were wrong. murtan feygor had got his throat shot away during the fight for vervunhive, and his every word came flat and monotone through a speech enhancer sewn into his larynx. since then, he'd sounded permanently sarcastic, though several ghosts, varl and corbec in particular, had opined that it was no great disability because he always had anyway. fierce as a cornered plague-rat, he was snide and cunning and trusted no one except rawne. but he wasn't the nastiest piece of work the tanith first could offer either. banda whispered to caffran. they were sitting a little way down the wagon with their backs to the door, close enough to overhear their platoon commander's remarks. jessi banda was verghast, another grade one sniper like muril. fortis binary was a piece of hell the tanith had endured several years before the fight at vervunhive had brought the new recruits in. any advice? in the next wagon. sort it out, will you? nessa? hwlan? jajjo, a mixed-race verghastite with dark brown skin and darker eyes shrugged and smiled. he slid the haft of his nine seventy out to use as a baton. if it came to fists, he'd get in on criid's side. cuu was a vicious worm. the scout saw that dafelbe and skeen both looked ready to jump in, and nessa had got to her feet too. but if it went off, hwlan thought would it help to get involved? would criid thank them? probably not. she'd want to assert her command over cuu alone, to make the point. hwlan could feel vril's hand on his arm, pulling him down. vril clearly thought the same way too. cuu picked smoke-weed off his lip. but i notice you haven't shown respect to my rank since this conversation began. don' talk that way. don' be doin' that. go hunt for your brain. i hear the loxad have it in a little glass trophy box. kolea asked cuu. he shuffled forward, screwing up his eyes in confusion. kolea wavered. criid knew that kolea had been struggling to remember cuu's name, and had failed. criid pushed a hand out towards cuu's face, and he dodged back, but it was a ruse. the real sting was criid's left leg, sweeping round at knee height. cuu crashed over onto the straw-covered floor, hard. cuu responded with a gender-related obscenity. in reply, the base of her hand against the back of his head, she smashed him nose-first into the decking. there was a crack that made them all wince, and it wasn't wood. blood was running from his broken nose. vril gasped. what do you say, cuu? criid walked down the rocking wagon and sat herself beside kolea. gaunt rode the a train. his carriage had once been a coach-class car, but its luxury days were long passed. even so, he knew that the worn upholstery of the compartments was a fething sight sweeter than the transit arrangements of his ghosts. he sat in a compartment with buzzel, chief medic dorden, hark and the regiment's chaplain, ayatani zweil. gaunt's adjutant, corporal beltayn, waited at the door. zweil and hark were arguing about something, but gaunt wasn't paying attention. he gazed out of the window, watching the vales and fields and woods and townships of mittel aexe flicker past. buzzel looked shocked. snapped zweil testily, though he clearly didn't. he got up. gaunt returned his gaze to the landscape outside. low, hilly country broken by stands of trees and small lakes. it would have been almost picturesque if not for the weather. rain splashed along the windows of the speeding train. buzzel shrugged. hark looked at dorden and both men sighed. gaunt looked at buzzel. baen called. there were lights on the track behind them, and the sound of labouring engines. mkoll waved his men off the track. a jolting field truck, smeared in mud, rumbled past turning east. behind it came a staggering file of artillery tractors towing 0.12 feldkannone pieces. aexe alliance infantry in filthy green greatcoats walked beside the column. their heads were covered with canvas bag-hoods with rough-cut slits for eyes and mouths. most carried metal prybars or coils of wire matting to free up wheels when they bogged in. the hooded men reminded bonin of the scarecrows used on the fruit farms back home in county cuhulic. no one paid any attention to the tanith team. twenty tractors, thirty, thirty-five, then twelve high-sided haycarts piled with shells that had been jacketed for protection in wicker sleeves. the carts were drawn by hippine teams, ten to a cart. these beasts were thin and wildeyed, and stank of disease as they whinneyed and snorted along, every step a struggle. after the slow carts came infantry, trudging under the weight of full field kit, their heads wrapped up in their dirty scarves. mkoll watched an officer step out of file and stand by the signpost waving his troops around in the right direction. after a few minutes, the officer turned and walked over to the tanith. then he noticed mkoll's rank pins and made a more formal salute. mkoll bit back a comment about the filthy state of the locals, but fevrierson had seen the look. mkoll nodded. men around sniggered. mkoll asked fevrierson. a whistle blew from the rear echelon, then a second, then another coming up the file. mkoll wondered if it was an attack, though there was no sign of anything and the chilly, wet landscape was otherwise virtually silent. they heard hooves. cavalry was moving up the road at a canter, and the infantry were standing off to let them through. the aexegarians cheered and waved their scarves and gens-filly bonnets as the riders went past. the cavaliers were dressed in blue and gold coats with bright green sashes and white, bell-top shakos. they sat upright and haughty, eyes front, saddle-sabres clattering at their hips. their mounts were gigantic flightless birds with grey feathers and vast hooked beaks, powering along on massive, blue-fleshed limbs. said hwlan. the front riders held lances with fluttering bannerols, but the rest carried short-action rifles. over sixty hussars galloped past and then the infantry returned to the road. after another forty-five minutes, mkoll realised the track was sloping down, though the landscape around remained spread out in its flat pocked immensity. they were entering the rear portions of the trench network. the horizon had been clear earlier because everything vital had been sunk and dug in. the workings were of immense size, some as wide as city streets and ten metres deep. where they extended below the water table, duckboards had been laid down and teams of sappers were manning hand-pumped bilges. strings of electrical lights ran down the carefully revetted walls and mkoll could smell the ozone of shield generators. armoured vehicles and trucks moved down the working line, and when one appeared, they had to stand to in lay-bys cut into the trench wall to allow them past. troops hurried back and forth, some in greens, some in greys, a few in blues and golds or russets, all locals, all filthy. it was like entering a partially buried city. some sections of trench were entirely roofed in with wired flakboard, with lighting hanging from the tunnel roofs. and they'd built it well. massive, mainstreet-style reserve trenches, often shored up with rockcrete, off which ran barrack dugouts to the west and communication and support trenches to the east, towards the front. running as they did from sap-heads and deep munition wells, the support trenches were shallower but zig-zagged, or were well provided with solid traverses to protect the vulnerable links and make them easier to defend compartmentally. to the east about a kilometre away by mkoll's estimation, lay the line of the fire trenches. to the west rearwards, lay deeper pits accessed by communication trenches laid with narrow-gauge rails. even the main artillery was dug in subsoil, mkoll thought the rails were for shell-carts. a few moments later they had to pause to allow barrows of massive wicker-wrapped shells to be heaved across the reserve trench and up the supply channels to the gun-pits. fevrierson checked his watch. the genswick foot halted and stood easy in a firing trench as fevrierson reported to the sector's staff blockhouse. he took mkoll with him. the blockhouse was a series of armoured rooms buried deep in the ground off the reserve mainway. it had folding shutters and gas curtains at the entrance. inside, it was warm and damp and busy. there was a chart room, and a vox-annex where a row of signallers chattered into bulky old-style field sets. sheafs of thick vox-line cables ran out along the entrance hall and away through loopholes. inside the main entrance, sweating, ruddy-faced runners sat on a bench, waiting to be sent out again. mkoll waited at a reinforced door while fevrierson signed in. from his vantage point, the tanith could see a small command room filled with military aides grouped around a low map table. they were all in shabby but impressive number one uniforms: more blue and gold, more green, some yellow, some grey and some dark red. mkoll hadn't got the hang of the varied insignia or liveries yet. the men in grey tended to be quite dark skinned, and the few in red were pale and red or blond haired. fevrierson was reporting to a sallow-faced general whose green uniform seemed loose and ill-fitting. the man's face was drawn. he's lost weight since that kit was tailored for him, mkoll thought. the general talked to fevrierson for a while, pointing to items on the map-table, and signed an order sheet. then fevrierson said something, and indicated mkoll. the general nodded and strode over to where the tanith scout was waiting. mkoll snapped a salute that the general gave back. he produced the papers gaunt had drawn up for him, countersigned by buzzel. general hargunten looked them over. he said after a while, his accent new to mkoll. the colonel snorted. his skin was very pale and slightly freckled and his side-shaved hair was red-gold. the colonel grunted and turned away. go with the lieutenant here. see your way around. mkvenner nodded and made off. mkoll watched the tall, lithe figure retreating down the busy trench. mkoll joined fevrierson in the command dugout. it was little more than a shed built into the leading edge of the trench. there was a v-shaped binocular periscope on a tripod stand, and mkoll took a lookout. it was his first look at the battleground. in the twilight it was a miserable place, though he was certain it would look even more miserable by day. torn earth, incomprehensible wreckage, tall piquet fences of dangling wire. a kilometre away, the shattered land dipped a little and spread into a wide flood plain of poisoned water and stagnant pools interspersed with muddy islets and ridge-crests of shell-blown soil. he realised a river would look like that if it had been shelled for forty years. the banks, the environs, even the riverbed itself would have been ripped apart and pummelled into ruins. but the water still flowed. where once it had been a proud, major river meandering through meadows and sleepy villages on its long journey to the sea, it was now cut loose, leaking out across the punished landscape like blood from a wound, its original form and structure lost to the war. a few seconds more and other starshell flares burst, glowing, in the sky. want one? then a fourth. then a dozen heavy impacts along the line to the north-west. fevrierson cried. mkoll asked. he gasped. fevrierson said. mkoll grabbed the scope. out in the no-man's land of the naeme valley, phantom shapes were advancing towards them. four! this is four! thirteen. the shells coming in had probably travelled more like fifteen or twenty. fevrierson's astonished reaction alone was enough. he'd not seen anything like it. that wasn't a good sign. mkvenner and hwlan rejoined mkoll, as did bonin a moment later. fevrierson had got a few men onto the firestep and mkoll heard the first dull bangs of trench mortars and the chatter of a machine cannon. almost immediately, as if in answer, the top of the trench's back wall started to take hits. boards splintered and scads of earth flew out. the gathering mobs of allied infantry slotted long, bill-tipped blades to their rifles. well? while there's still time. hold and repel� hold to repel! fevrierson was shouting. suddenly, a significant chunk of the facing parapet blew in, ripping panel-boards and brushwood revetting out of the wall and tossing men aside onto the duckboards. the first dements of the enemy wave scrambled down into the trench through the section their grenades had taken out. they wore khaki coats, brown corduroy breeches and slimeslick puttees, and dark green steel helmets over dirty woollen toques or chain-mail splinter masks. most carried bulky autorifles with ugly saw-edged bayonets, but others had pistols and long-handled wire-cutters. mkoll saw at least three who were wearing bulky grenadier waistcoats, the multiple canvas pockets stuffed with ball and stick bombs. spilling in through the breach, the trench raiders turned their guns and fired down the ditch line into the milling genswick foot. other attackers breasted the parapet and started a rapid-fire enfilade into the heart of the section's defence. there was a thick mob of alliance men between mkoll and the raiders, most of them trying to run or find cover. he could hear the whinnying smack of the enemy bullets thumping into the jostling bodies, punching through worsted and flannel, through canvas and leather, through flesh. hit, some men convulsed but were held upright by the press. others screamed because they were hit or because they were desperate not to be. one man was yanked up out of the mob by the force of an enfilading shot to the neck, his body cartwheeling over on top of the others. a ball bomb, round and black with a fizzing paper fuse, bounced off another man's shoulder and then blew the front of the command dugout into the air in a shower of planks. there was general uproar from the genswick troopers as they tried to flee from the breach and the crossfire. the bulk of them were penned in by their own confusion like animals in a slaughterhouse channel. fevrierson and some of the men up on the firestep managed to return fire over the heads of the mob, and mkoll counted at least two raiders go down. mkoll yelled at the men in the trench and as they ducked and cowered, he and bonin fired a storm of full auto-shots over their heads in support of the sideswiping fire of mkvenner and hwlan. the raiders fell back under the hail of energy rounds. the front three or four were cut straight down, and fell onto the men behind them, tripping a few of them. mkoll waded through the huddled genswick soldiers in the trench base and opened up a field of fire on the raiders coming over the broken parapet, punishing their enfilade. he felt a rifle round thump into his chest armour, and others pass close by into the earthen wall, but he kept firing. bolt-action rifles now began to volley at the intruding force. bonin drew his lasrifle up to his shoulder and took a swift aim, snapping a single shot that dropped an enemy grenadier in the middle of the raider group. the ball bomb in his hand exploded and touched off the contents of his waistcoat. mkoll yelled, storming forward with bonin. the raided section had been effectively cleared by the blast. the air was full of soil dust fine like flour, and it was settling across everything, making dark sticky patches where it mixed with spilled blood. the bodies of raiders, scorched black and twisted, lay across the firestep and the trench floor. one hung upside down from the parapet wire. mkoll, bonin and five of the genswick foot rushed the firestep at the broken section of the trench in time to intercept the next raiding party as it came over the parapet. there was a savage flurry of point-blank shooting that knocked three of the raiders back out of the trench and one of the genswickers off the step. then it was hand-to-hand, brutal, blind. mkoll used his rifle butt to deflect a bayonet that jabbed down at him, and then dubbed the attacker in the kneecap with it. one of the genswick lads bayoneted an attacker through the belly and hoisted him up into the air like a labourer pitchforking a straw bale. bonin, who'd had time to fix his silver tanith warknife to his rifle's bayonet lug, killed one man outright and then slashed the thigh of another, cracking the man's head with his lasgun's butt as he fell. a pistol fired twice in mkoll's ear and the alliance private next to him screamed and fell, clutching his face. mkoll fired his rifle and shot out the throat of the grenadier with the autopistol.  the man slipped off the parapet where he had been standing, and ended up sitting, dead, on the firestep with his back to the trench wall. another few seconds of maniacal punching and clubbing, and the last of the raiders dropped back, denied. bonin and two genswickers stood up at the parapet and started firing down into the dark to drive the raiders back out into the war-waste. along the trench, fevrierson and his men were now laying down a serious rifle fusillade from the step, the chatter of their solid round shots punctuated by the cracks of mkvenner's and hwlan's lasguns. mkoll crouched on the firestep and started to plunder the bombs from the dead grenadier's waistcoat. the balls had friction fuses that lit when a paper twist was yanked out. he fired them one by one, tossing them up and out over the parapet. the stick grenades had long wooden grips like brush handles with loops of linen dangling from pins in their bases. mkoll realised you put your hand through the loops before swinging the grenades out. as each one sailed off, its pin was left hanging from his wrist on the loop. one of fevrierson's men, wounded in the arm, came up and helped him lob the bombs out into the night. the tanith sergeant switched round the moment he heard las-fire from his left. yelled one of the alliance men. mkoll yelled to bonin, and jumped down off the firestep, running along the trench to support caober and baen. mkvenner was running with him, along with a handful of fevrierson's men. the traverse shielded them all from the raiders in the next section, but also denied them aim. baen hugged the end of the traverse and snapped off shots round the corner as often as he dared. a stick bomb came tumbling end over end across the traverse. almost too fast to see, mkvenner caught it in mid-air and slung it back. the blast curled smoke out round the end of the traverse. one of the genswickers declared, and charged round the end of the defensive fortification with two of his comrades. all three were riddled with rifle shots and slammed back against the revetment wall. they hung there for a millisecond and then flopped onto their faces. mkoll glanced at mkvenner. mkoll nodded. he waved caober with them and pointed baen to hold the corner of the traverse. the three ghosts threw out their camo-cloaks, and sheeted them over their shoulders, draping them expertly so that one hem-fold formed a hood over their heads. then they went up the back wall of the fire trench and over the top. the surface behind the fire trench was packed earth and pools of mud. it was essentially dark, but the heavy barrage continued to strobe the entire line with fierce flashes. in the heat of the brutish trench fight, mkoll had almost forgotten about the bombardment. it was still going on: the superheavy long range shells plastering the command and supply trench areas of the entire peinforq line as far as he could see. some shields still held, but only a half-hearted sporadic barrage answered the enemy thunder. mkoll, caober and mkvenner crawled forward, shrouded by their capes, hugging the mud. they'd sheathed their warknives and had slung their lasrifles over their shoulders under the capes so they wouldn't jar against stones or metal fragments on the ground. they slithered, feeling their way. every time the light of a shell-blast lit the sky they froze. down in the trench to their right they could hear baen and the genswick boys duelling patchily with the raiders, squeezing off shots around the traverse. mkoll could hear the raiders shouting to each other in a language he didn't understand. five more raiders were hurtling down the trench onto them. mkvenner ignored the rifle rounds whizzing past him and strode towards them, firing his pistol. the first and second raiders lurched backwards as if they'd been poleaxed. the third slumped on his face. the fourth was straggling with a jammed bolt when mkvenner's shot snapped his head round and blew out his cheek. caober screamed, and threw himself at the raider, slamming him down hard. caober pinned the soldier with his right forearm and expertly rotated his warknife in his left hand, switching the blade from tip up to tip down. once it was down, caober thumped the blade repeatedly into the raider's chest. mkoll had finished off the raiders half-killed by the tube-charge and came running back down the fire trench with baen and the genswick troopers on his heels. still more raiders, including a grenadier, were behind the second five. mkoll's pistol toppled one, and then baen was firing on full auto with his lasgun. the alliance troopers beside him supported with fire from their rifles. mkoll moved forward over the crumpled bodies. he ordered and a pair of infantry men ran ahead. one of the genswickers shouted back. caober struggled up and ran to where baen was kneeling over mkvenner. there was an appalling spill of blood. he had a nub of doth jammed to his ear and when he took it away, blood squirted from his ear. caober gasped with such relief baen and mkvenner both started to laugh. there were no more raids against station 143 that night, though fevrierson's men stood to on the firestep at alert drill. word filtered back that stations 129, 131, 146 and 147 had been intruded with serious losses, though by midnight only 146 was still the scene of fighting as alliance troops doggedly drove the raiders out. unconfirmed reports said that an entire section had been overrun between stations 287 and 311, and from the noise of combat washing down the line, mkoll could believe it. the enemy barrage ended, abruptly, at midnight, leaving just a dismal fog of ash vapour and fyceline smoke drifting down over the allied lines. at 01.00, the alliance gun-dens commenced a counter-bombardment that mercilessly whipped the shadik front-line positions across the naeme until dawn. at 02.15, with the punitive artillery searing the sky behind them, mkoll assembled his team and bade farewell to fevrierson. the young lieutenant saluted and shook mkoll's hand, and many of his weary company clapped and cheered. mkoll nodded. bonin grinned. fevrierson asked. � gaunt asked, attempting to shave using the tepid water. beltayn was laying out gaunt's service uniform on the bed. he brushed the crown of gaunt's cap and set it on the bed. then he came over to gaunt and peered at his cut. gaunt smiled. dressed, and with a tab of beltayn's cigarette paper stuck to his shaving wound, gaunt took his caffeine outside. the day was clear and promisingly warm, though the stink of fyceline was everywhere. he stopped on the pension's terrace to chat with a krassian major and two officers from the seqgewehr, and saw rawne and feygor demolishing a fried breakfast in the small dining room. a column of tanks clanked past through the square. gaunt finished his drink, put the empty cup on one of the terrace tables, and walked across the road to the chapel st. avigns where the allied staff headquarters was sited. rhonforq was one of the octal burgs � eight high church municipalities that sustained the authority of the sea of ghrennes through mittel aexe. its church and cloister had been built in 502, ten years after the first colony footing at samonparliane, and before the war its chief activities had been wool-carding, button manufacture and cheese making. visitors were invited to throw a coin into the fountain of beati hagia or, if they were sound of limb, take in the hike to the sheffurd hills to view the birthplace of governor-general daner fep kvelsteen, whose autograph and seal were included in the famous four at the bottom of the great aexe declaration of sovereignty. gaunt knew that much from a dog-eared, obsolete touring guide he'd discovered under his bed the night before. allied staff headquarters was thronging with activity. in the inner cloister, a rank of despatch riders waited on humming motorcycles.  sheafs of telegraph and vox-cable trunked out of windows and noodled up into the dish arrays anchored to the rooves. a shield mast attached to a portable generator dominated the quadrangle, the grass beneath it brown and dead from radiation. gaunt hurried up the front steps of the main chapel, accepting the salutes of passing alliance officers. beg pardon, sir. the lord general has gone ahead to meiseq, but he's expected back tomorrow night. i'll ring through. the voice echoed around the hall. gaunt looked round to see a tall, pale, ginger haired officer in a dark red uniform advancing towards him across the paved hallway. gaunt fell into step with the taller man, and they walked down towards the doors of the main situations room. there was something about ankre, something in his bearing and manner, that made gaunt bristle. but he ignored the feeling. he'd been guard long enough to know that you often didn't like the men you had to count as allies. stifling personal opinion usually helped get the job done. ankre paused, not sure how best to deal with the criticism. it seemed like you took a bruising. i have eyes and ears. so� new enemy tactics, then? a sentry in green alliance fatigues saluted and held the door for them. the nave of the old chapel had been converted for military use. the windows were taped and blacked, though gaunt could make out the lead ridges of the old stained glass. flak-board baffles lined the room, banked with sandbags, and the air was dry and warm and smelled of electricity. glow-globes floated beneath the rafters, illuminating a central area busy with technicians, aides and officers. portable codifiers and high-gain vox-casters had been uncrated and set up on trestles. there was a constant murmur of voices, a chatter of machines, the occasional whistle of tuning vox-channels, background static. a pair of hooded acolytes from the adeptus mechanicus were blessing the servitors that were being installed at the new imperial vox-units. the situations room was a confidential area. inside the door, gaunt had to give his name and serial code to a clerk and was issued with a small green pin-badge. high command wanted a thorough record of everyone who came and went. ankre led gaunt across to a chart table, which gaunt studied keenly. it was a complete mess of over-mapped gibberish. ankre gave him a blurred, low-detail map showing only a small field section. it had been printed on flimsy paper. i just don't believe it. you are saying that, in certain circumstances, most likely the kind of circumstances when it really matters, i am supposed to answer to a junior officer? i am expected to put my command � my regiment� into his hands? ankre leafed through it. gaunt could see that most of the pages were typewritten inserts, pasted or stapled in. his tactical staff working party drew it up once we'd been advised of your approach. ankre seemed reluctant to let the book go, but handed it over after a pause. gaunt read down the badly typed order docket. the senior alliance officer in your line area is major neillands of the feinster highlanders. here. it is quite specific. the imperial expedition is termed �auxiliary support'. gaunt took off his cap and his gloves and set them down on the edge of the chart table. this action gave him a few seconds to breathe deeply and still his rage. ankre stepped back a pace and lowered his head slightly, aggressively. gaunt slid the map and the data-slate into his coat and put his gloves and cap back on. he strode away, then turned and glared back at ankre. ankre said nothing. the whole situations room had fallen silent. dorden glanced up at caober. caober faltered and his voice tailed off. he was a fine scout, but his story-telling ability left everything to be desired. dorden continued to wind bandages tightly around caober's ankle. dorden laughed, and so did everyone else � lesp, washing his hands in a tin bowl, chayker and foskin sorting surgical tools. the laughter stopped. no one wanted mkvenner to think they were taking the piss out of him. mkvenner was one of those ghosts you respected, every second of the day. dorden could tell at a glance he was holding himself stiffly as he moved. mkoll started to take off his webbing and jacket, but it clearly hurt him to lift his arms, so dorden helped him strip down to the waist. dorden tutted and sprayed mkoll's wound with counter-septic. by his side, foskin clucked in amazement. he'd been folding mkoll's clothes and kit. he held up a mangled large calibre round. mkoll took it and put in his trouser pocket. he had his own battlefield superstitions. oh, him. the red-head. oh, i told them all right.  i don't think they were listening. the alliance soldiers we saw were tired and over-stretched. ill too, most of them. low sanitation, low hygiene. what's worse, they have precious little discipline. they'd never seen that before, not like that. i think they were fairly fit as front-line infantry, but when those new super-guns opened up, they were milling and broken and scared. gaunt nodded. mkoll shrugged, and then winced and wished he hadn't. gaunt was about to say something else when angry voices broke into the mill hall. gaunt stood. ana curth took a deep breath. she'd been a well-respected and well-paid civilian medic on verghast before the zoican war and, to the amazement of dorden and gaunt, had elected to join the tanith regiment at the act of consolation. no one had ever found out why she'd cast aside a comfortable, rewarding lifestyle in favour of the thankless miseries of an imperial guard medicae posting. gaunt believed it was because she had a sense of duty that probably put them all to shame. they were fething lucky to have her. curth started. smiled dorden. there was laughter ringing from the old wool mill. his driver had told him this was the place set aside for the imperial guard medicae units. laughter seemed a strange sound to hear. he walked in from the car, entering a large hall where eight men and a woman stood around, hooting and chuckling. it seemed like the officer had just told a really good joke. four of the men and the woman were medics. the others, apart from the officer in his stem cap, were black-tunicked troopers, all of them injured. he cleared his throat and the laughter stopped. they all looked round. count golke was a quiet, silver-haired aexegarian dressed in a dark green uniform that showed no decoration apart from the insignia of aexegary on the collar and shoulder boards, and the golden aquila medal pinned at his throat. he walked with a slight limp, and gaunt could see that his neatly trimmed silver beard had been grown, in part, to disguise old burns on his cheek and throat. he introduced himself as chief of staff/liaison. they walked together across the yard outside the mill. i confess that night i was rather distant. forgive me if i was distracted. the surprise news of the imperial arrival, my unexpected decoration � something other than the futile round of cocktail welcome parties and handshaking. you've quite rattled redjacq ankre. colonel ankre displayed to me a real ignorance of modem warfare methods. he is blinkered, clinging to outmoded and discredited principles and strategies. golke smiled. golke chuckled ruefully. look, sir, i know aexegary has a long and illustrious history of military success, but you're still fighting wars the way your ancestors did. shadik is not a bellicose neighbour state to be bested on the field and then invited over for diplomatic reparations. it is a cancer, a spreading evil of chaos that will not, ever, play by the old rules. gaunt pulled out the scrappy map ankre had given him. now do me a favour. advance your regiment to the appointed stations. show willing. i'll go back to the supreme commander and petition him to act on your advice. a day or two, perhaps three. then we might see results. sergeant tona criid? i like the sound of that. � tona criid, sergeant it was the ghosts' third day on the line. the tension remained. since the night of mkoll's advance party, there'd been no bombardment. on day two, the enemy had assaulted the line twenty-five kilometres north at station 317, but otherwise it had been quiet. one-third of the regiment had advanced to the line, leaving the other two-thirds in reserve at rhonforq. at the end of the first week, they were to rotate, and begin a pattern that meant no trooper stayed on the line for more than a week, and every trooper got two weeks' rest in reserve in every three. gaunt, of course, hoped the tanith wouldn't be staying at the front for anything like that long. at the line, the ghosts were caked in mud after the first few hours, and crawling with lice after the first day. they slept, as best they could, curled up under the lip of the parapet or in hand-scooped dugouts. criid had become so muddy she'd decided not to fight it any more. she'd plastered mud across her face and matted it into her hair. fifteen minutes later, all but two of her platoon had followed suit and daubed themselves with mud. kolea hadn't, because he hadn't understood what was going on. cuu hadn't, because, well, he was cuu. still, criid congratulated herself, i seem to have most of the platoon pulling together. maybe i can do this. ten platoon occupied station 290, with eleven platoon, obel's, to their north, and sixteen platoon, maroy's, to their south. each station represented about a kilometre of fire trench, broken in twenty metre intervals by traverses. they had a dugout bunker with a field telephone and vox, but the ghosts' personal vox-links had made that obsolete most of the time. three times a day, criid did her tour, accompanied by hwlan and dafelbe. she checked trench integrity, she checked that food was getting through, she checked the obs stations. she individually inspected each trooper's kit, ammo supply, and feet for trench foot. the third day was dismal.  rain blew in from the west angled in such a manner that the trench sides offered absolutely no shelter. the rain also tasted of something, something faintly metallic, faintly chemical. someone said that blister gas had been used the day before up north in the meiseq box, and some troopers put on their breather hoods or tied cloth over their mouths. the sky was low and oppressive, churning with fast-moving cloud that was almost black. it sapped the colour from the day. faces became pale, eye sockets shadowed. some of the trench's previous incumbents � the seventy-seventh lunsgatte rifle brigade �had stayed behind. a detachment of thirty had been remaindered to man the trench mortars in the pocket dugouts spaced behind the main fire trench. their fire-officer, a sergeant called hartwig, joined criid when she toured the mortar dens. he was tall and humourless, huddled in a mud-flecked grey oilskin, toque and a green kepi with a metal badge that showed some sort of bear-like animal. his men didn't mix much with the tanith. they seemed content to live in the cramped hollows of the dens. criid got the impression hartwig and his men didn't think much of a unit that included women, let alone one that was led by one. the mortars were squat, blue-metal machines called feldwerfers, and used compressed gas to fire the three kilo shells pneumatically. the crews kept the weapons spotlessly clean, they were forever polishing and oiling them. in contrast, the men themselves were filthy and their uniforms piecemeal. most wore toques or loose hoods, with sleeveless leather jackets or fleeces, and many had flat sheets of armour tied or strung across their chests. dirt caked their hands and faces black. interspersed with the mortars were favell-pattern spring guns, a heavy little catapult engine that looked to criid like some kind of pipe organ. it took two men to operate the double windlass and crank back the long throwing arm to the cock-stop. when the trigger lanyard was pulled, the cluster of massive springs in the main body of the weapon slammed the arm up and lobbed grenades or ball bombs out over the fire trench and into the battlefield. hartwig assured criid that the favell could send a grenade over two hundred and fifty metres. the trick was to set the grenade's fuse so that it didn't detonate high in its arc. they needed to blow on the ground, or near it, but if the grenadiers left the fuse too long, there was a risk that the enemy would have time to gather them up and toss them back. one member of each spring gun team had a clay pipe on the go at all times, an ignition source ready and waiting to start fuses that was a lot less fiddly than matches or gun-string. the seventy-seventh lunsgatte weren't the only prior inhabitants who had stayed in the fire trench. shrunken, eroded body parts protruded from the trench floor and sometimes the wall, usually where the rain had exposed them. during a heavy period of action three years before, criid learned, the troops at these stations had been obliged to bury their dead in the trench itself. water damage was slowly raising them back into the daylight. during her midday tour on the third day, criid found lubba and vril trying to shore up a section of revetment that was falling in thanks to the rain. part of the parapet overhang had become a gutter for the rainwater, which was now gushing into the trench in a thick stream. the task was made all the more unpleasant because where the timber had come away, ancient cadavers had been exposed, curled and almost mummified. dafelbe suggested, pointing at the liquid mud gushing down over the lip. criid ventured. criid called after the scout. hwlan nodded. they moved on a little way. criid checked the next two or three troopers at the firestep: vulli, jajjo, kenfeld, subeno. kenfeld's boots were leaking and he needed foot-powder. then they reached cuu, or at least cuu's position. criid called to the next man along. the trooper called back. they waited, and cuu reappeared. as soon as he saw criid, he unslung his rifle and held it out for inspection, wordlessly. there was no expression in his eyes. his face still bore the bruise marks where she'd dented it. couldn't wait. my belly's a mess. gakking food round here. report to dorden. get him to fix you up with salts or a shot. then right back here, you understand me? criid watched cuu walk away until he was out of sight round the next traverse. in the next fire bay, criid found pozetine, mosark and nessa bourah huddled in scrapes hulled out under the dripping parapet. they were playing dice, but she could tell their hearts weren't in it. she ran a quick inspection, though the three were able troopers who didn't need much steering, and asked if there were any problems. he was a short, square-set vervunhiver with a boxer's splayed nose, ex-vervun primary, and a hell of a shot. a shoe-in for sniper specialisation in fact, had it not been for his grievous lack of patience. he worried, he fidgeted. a sniper he was not. pozetine nodded. his fingers were working the dice, making them move in and out between his knuckles. it was easy to say. no soldier liked the waiting hours. they had a habit of magnifying fears and gnawing at nerves. kolea? you okay? whatever. she'd never know. she'd never be able to ask kolea, because kolea couldn't even remember ouranberg, let alone the motives that had once driven his life. the kids. they gonna be okay? her heart was banging in her ribcage. it was almost like the old gol kolea was in arm's reach. the canteen barrow had passed along the fire trench north of station 290 about fifteen minutes before, dishing out pieces of dry rye-bread and a watery gruel made of fish stock and tough root vegetables to the men of eleven platoon. now trooper gutes was coming along through the rain with the wash bin, collecting up the troopers' mess tins to take them up the supply trench and rinse them at the standpipe tap at rear/290. it was a rota task, and gutes had drawn for the day. he didn't grumble, but it was a scummy job. by the time he'd collected all the mess tins, the wash bin would be slopping and full. piet gutes was one of the older tanith troopers, drawn and tired. it wasn't physical fatigue he suffered from. it was the wearying attrition of guard life. the hopeless straggle to get through each day, knowing there was no happy ending waiting for them. no homeworld. no family embrace to return to. the day tanith had died, gutes' daughter finra had been twenty-one, and her daughter foona just four months old. it had been a wrench leaving them, but the emperor called, and the emperor was the emperor. piet gutes woke up some nights, sit-up-straight awake, with the last fire-flash of tanith fading in his mind's eye. that final, shuddering cough of flame and light that signalled the death of the world that'd raised him. it had been just a little thing, a wink in the night he'd witnessed it from the obs ports of the troop ship. just a tiny, silent flash. how could that have been tanith dying, he often wondered. the mantle splitting. the oceans evaporating. the continents sliding into each other and disintegrating. the great nalwood forests licking into cinders in a wall of white heat. the core, cut loose, erupting and boiling out into the vacuum. piet gutes supposed that anything, even the most important and profound event in his life or anyone's life, would seem like nothing more than a tiny, silent flash if you saw it from far enough away. he wondered about it, sometimes, washing grease off mess tins, sorting power dips, sewing buttons back onto his tunic. the galaxy was big and everything in it was small, and he was small too. the emperor's dead! really? yeah � that tiny flash just then. did you see it? the imperium's fallen! sacred feth, you kidding? no� just that little flash. you must've noticed. far away. it was all he wanted these days. he called, plodding down the fire bay with both hands on the yoke of the big metal pail. he straggled into the gun-nest where caill and melyr were hunched down beside their support weapon. caill tossed his tin in, half-finished, but melyr was still chasing the last drips of gravy with a scrap of caill's left over bread. gutes liked melyr. heavy-set, solid, an ace with a fat cannon or a rocket tube. but he hated seeing him there. bragg had been eleven's cannon man. hark had switched melyr in from twenty-seven when bragg was killed. it was almost unseemly.  caill, the best ammo humper in the regiment in gutes' opinion, had just about been wedded to bragg. now here he was running boxes and feeding belts for someone else. times change. needs must. get far enough away and none of it looks big enough to be important anyway. he was glad caill was settling in with his new partner. that's what really counted. he knew caill was still down on himself. he'd left bragg to run for fresh ammo, and by the time he'd got back, bragg was done. three loxatl flechette rounds at close range, that's what gutes had heard. like he'd eaten a tube-charge. so much mess they'd been hard pushed to find enough to bury, and bragg had been a big guy. feth happens, gutes thought. he stumbled on, under a reinforced arch, into the next fire bay, wishing he had a hand free to brash away the biterflies that buzzed around his face. loglas had told him about a trooper up the line who'd let those things settle and then woke up with his brain eaten out by hatching larvae. piet gutes didn't fancy that. he did however wonder how someone with his brain eaten out by larvae had managed to wake up at all. an inconsistency in the story. maybe loglas had been pulling his leg. every ghost's mess tin was etched with his surname and pin code. the fun part of this job was getting the right tin back to the right body. fun part. yeah, right. gutes stopped at the end of the bay and put his bucket down. greasy slops rocked out over the lip. mad larkin slowly turned back from the loophole where his long-las was resting. he smiled slightly when he saw gutes. they'd been good buddies since the founding fields. it was nice to see him smile. larkin seemed edgier than ever these days. gutes asked. larkin looked around and eventually produced his mess tin from a shelf in the revet side. melyr accepted the bonus rations with delight. he went back to his wash bin. his hand had found the knife now. he kept it behind his back. cuu's voice dropped to a raw whisper. larkin pulled back even further. he knew he had no hope of getting his long-las free from the loop-hole. he wanted to shout out but there was no one around. war's a messy thing, tanith. confused and all shit like that. middle of combat all crap flying this way and that. who's gonna notice if i get my payback? hlaine larkin was petrified. ever since phantine, he'd been guarding his back, waiting for this moment. and now lijah fething cuu had just come up on him when he least expected it. but those last few words bit clean through his terror. his eyes went dark, like a cloud had passed across the sun. we've come this far let's do it. fighting the pressure at his neck, larkin screamed. oddly, his scream sounded like a whistle. a whistle. two more blew. then another. loglas halted and looked up. the shell hit the back wall of the firebay and went off, kicking mud and slime and pieces of flakboard fifty metres into the air. a twenty-pounder at the very least. larkin saw it, saw the actual shell. the flint-grey casing, the barbed fins, like it was a piet playing in slow motion. he saw the huge flash. he saw one of the fins, a broken chunk of metal twenty centimetres by ten, whizzing out from the impact, turning in the air like a kid's throw-toy. loglas was reeling back from the concussive force of the blast when the flying fin hit him in the face. in slow motion, larkin saw the way it made loglas frown, then grimace, then twist his features into an expression no human face could make while it was alive. loglas' face caved in nose first, and his forehead tore away from his scalp like a yanked curtain. his head convulsed with the whiplash, his neck shattering as it bowed back. larkin howled. then he went deaf as the blast roar hammered him. colm corbec had emerged from his dugout at station 295 approximately sixty seconds before the first shell landed. something up? he repeated the cry three times before there was an ominous click which announced that the e-mag pulse of the enemy guns had killed the vox-signal. then the shells started to land. they fell in the rain. they fell like rain. they scattered in and out of the leading fire trench of the peinforq line's 55th sector from station 251 right up to 315 and over into 56th sector as far as 349. ten shells a second, heavy gauge from the deep super-siege batteries, and smaller howitzer rounds from the shadik front. in a space of two minutes, the air was full of mud fog and the atomised steam of debris over a stretch of fifteen kilometres. the ground was quaking. between 293 and 294, rawne and domor got their troopers into cover. amongst three platoon, wheln and leclan took shrapnel hits, torez lost an arm and famoss was decapitated. five metres of fire trench and a traverse simply vanished in a blizzard of spraying earth. sergeant agun soric slept through the first thirty seconds of the onslaught. the roar and vibration didn't wake him. it took trooper vivvo, shaking him and yelling in his face. soric snorted, and scrambled up. how could he have slept through this? over the constant howl of shells, he could hear debris spattering off the dugout wall. someone was screaming for a medic. short, stocky, grizzled, possessed of a mighty laugh and a temper corrosive as acid, soric had been a smeltery boss back on verghast. in the war there, he'd become a troop leader ad hoc, a resistance fighter. his exploits had left him with scar-tissue in place of one eye, a limp, and the eternal respect of vervunhivers. ibram gaunt hadn't thought twice about making soric a senior platoon leader. his ability to sleep was a throwback to the old days, when he'd been able to catch a nap despite the tumult of the smeltery line. now the knack seemed like a liability. he bundled vivvo outside, pressing a hand down on the younger man's shoulders to keep him low. the air was full of billowing, opaque fog that made them both choke and gasp violently. they couldn't see anything except the swirling vapour and fuzzy, bright flashes. the parapet at 292 was particularly low and waterlogged; a wide lake formed against its outside lip. soric coughed, and shoved vivvo back into the dugout. he stood alone for a moment, though how alone he couldn't tell. there could be men just a few metres away, soric thought, and i can't see them. he tried to shout out, but his mouth filled with mud droplets and he started choking again. besides, the continuous noise of detonations totally drowned him out. soric staggered back into the dugout. vivvo was on his hands and knees, his arms wrapped protectively over his head, retching up muddy liquid. soric sat down on the canvas stool. something jabbed into his hip and he discovered a message shell in the pocket of his breeches. he couldn't remember putting a message shell in his pocket. he unscrewed the brass cap and shook out a small fold of blue tissue paper. a sheet from a guard issue despatch pack. every sergeant had one, though they were seldom needed because of the vox-link. they were for emergencies, and soric was sure he hadn't used his pack since they'd arrived. but when he looked around, he saw it lying on the dugout's shelf, the paper seal torn off and the top sheet missing. soric unfolded the sheet. beltayn? throne of terra fix blades! stand ready to repel! keep it up! criid yelled. she started firing again. they were so damn close now, and despite everything, there were so damn many. brin milo, the youngest ghost of all, was right beside his platoon sergeant when the raiders came leaping in. one went right over milo's head and fell down as he landed awkwardly on the duckboards. sergeant domor turned and shot him dead where he lay. they'd been swarmed. sheer numbers had flung themselves at 293 and 294 and made it over the parapet. now three and twelve platoon faced the very worst that trench warfare had to offer. hand-to-hand in the narrow trench gully. the raiders wore khaki and brown, and most had gas-hoods and heavy helmets damped over their heads. they carried old-pattern autorifles, pistols and curved hangers. the world became very, very small. just a tight space between earthen walls, deafened by shells, full of jostling bodies. milo slashed and jabbed with his bayonet staggering back a step as blood gouted over him, and then fired point-blank at a khaki figure clawing at him. for a while � longer than most of the ghosts had been comfortable about to be truthful � milo had been the only civilian to escape the fall of tanith. gaunt had rescued him, though sometimes milo liked to explain it had been the other way around. because of that, he'd been seen by all as one part mascot, one part lucky charm� and his skill with the tanith pipes had come in handy. milo had made trooper as soon as he was old enough. according to corbec, varl, larkin, bragg � god-emperor rest him � milo had received more combat experience by the time he sewed on his first cap badge than many guardsmen did in five years. that was how it went when you were one of gaunt's chosen. at his own request, milo had been placed in domor's platoon. and from the notion that he was gaunt's lucky mascot. brin milo was no mascot. he was twenty-one years old standard, tall and strong, and he'd take no feth from anyone now. despite his age, the ghosts � especially the tanith � took him quite seriously. though milo only suspected it, both gaunt and corbec considered him squad leader material. brin milo had something to prove. it would be his destiny to have something to prove until the day he died. barely twenty metres north of milo, rawne's platoon was fending off an assault too. the trench was packed with wrestling, stinking, sweaty bodies. rawne couldn't see more than a few metres in any direction. he fired his laspistol, and slashed out with his warknife. feygor, soaked in blood, appeared alongside him, and together they smashed a little way into the khaki bodies bottled in the trench. they were treading over the wounded and the dead of both sides alike. rawne shouted. the squad's flame trooper was nowhere to be seen. nothing was anywhere to be seen, except the churning, stabbing figures of the enemy. then a pistol banged, its noise muffled by the close-packed bodies. rawne saw melwid fall, clutching his belly. he felt a dull ache in his own midriff. feygor yelled something and impaled the owner of the pistol on his bayonet. rawne fell over. he didn't mean to, but his legs had gone numb. he slumped sideways and hit his head on the revetment. sounds had become dull and distant. what a fething stupid way to fight a war, rawne thought. he struggled over and looked up. he dearly wished his legs would work. jessi banda, the platoon sniper, was curled into a scrape in the trench wall behind him. he barked. that wasn't right. not right at all. a shell went off overhead, and rawne flinched into her. when he did, it made her cough. banda! trooper banda! where are you hit? medic! he cried. no one was listening. her head nodded down. rawne tried to support her. chief! muril suggested. muril deftly calibrated her gunsight back to her own requirements and sat back on the step, straightening her right leg and flexing it. corbec said. he jumped off the step and planted a kiss on muril's dirty brow. he declared. she was nonplussed. okay� here's what we do. every second man, stand down from the step. those still on station, hold and stay vigilant. irvinn, you've got fire command here on the step.  move south. support domor's mob. hold the trench lengthways. you okay, mkvenner asked him quietly, so the others couldn't hear. corbec paused a moment and coughed. he'd always led from the front, and that had cost him. he'd lost the little finger of his left hand at voltis city. that had been the start of it. the start of the tally. menazoid had hurt him hard. hagia worse. on phantine, he'd been lucky to come out alive. deep wounds to the body and leg, taken during the cirenholm feth-for-all, followed up with a nosocomial dose of blood-poisoning. it was a wonder he wasn't made up of augmetic prosthetics. it was a wonder his luck had lasted this long. a verghastite trooper named androby occupied the last slot before the traverse. they moved around the traverse. for the second time in a week, mkvenner was advancing around a defencedivide into what could well be an enemy-stormed trench. corbec knew that. he'd heard mkoll's debrief about the fight at station 143. mkvenner didn't show any nerves at all. he was quiet, expressionless, his camo-cape draped over him. he led the way with his lasrifle up against his shoulder so that everywhere he looked, his gun pointed. he was so silent corbec couldn't tell he was there unless he could see him. corbec followed him, laspistol in one hand and a grenade in the other. the pin was already out and corbec was holding the spoon tightly in place with his big, hairy fist. behind corbec were sillo and cown. both had rifles with warknives fixed. sillo had been a dye-cutter on verghast, and he was quick and dependable. cown, good old cown, was one of the tanith die-hards, who'd been at the front of just about everything since the awful day they'd first shipped out. he was still getting used to the augmetic bicep and collarbone he'd won at cirenholm. to their rear came ponore and veddekin, both verghastites. ponore was a young, lank prematurely bald fellow who complained incessantly, and corbec didn't like him much. veddekin was taller, buck-toothed and younger. both of them knew how to use a lasgun, and both had seen action, most particularly on phantine. corbec wondered if either of them had killed yet. he didn't know, and it was too late to ask. rerval brought up the back. he'd left his vox-set with androby, and carried an extra bag of field dressings. corbec knew rerval was a solid fighter. it was easy to forget the war-skills of the vox-troopers. corbec hoped raglon would change that conception now he'd been promoted from vox ops to platoon leader. besides his rifle, rerval carried a pharos-pattern flare pistol so they could signal back if things started to cook. the trench seemed empty. the light was bad and the air was misty with ordnance fumes. corbec could smell wet soil, promethium, the raw stink of the untreated timber used for the duckboards. this section of fire trench ran for ten metres, curving slightly north-west, and ended in another solid traverse. there was an opening in the back wall four metres in that went through to a gun-den. mkvenner checked it, and reported it was empty. a pneumo-mortar and shells, but no gunners. mkvenner put a finger to his lips and the verghastite shut up. they crocodiled along, squad members hugging alternate walls. here was a discarded lasrifle. here, the broken haft of an entrenching tool. items of personal kit were visible in the scrapes. musette bags, picts of loved ones, igniters and smokes, respirator masks, vacuum-packed ration bricks, bed rolls, balled-up woollen vests. like they'd left in a hurry, corbec thought. they reached the second traverse. mkvenner held up a hand. he pointed to the flakboarded back wall of the trench. there was a clotted splatter of blood, matted with strands of hair. mkvenner made a signal, one hand over the other, and dropped onto his belly. corbec stepped aside and let cown through. corbec led the others around. the next fire-bay was empty too, of the living at least. fresh corpses virtually filled the trench bottom. slaughtered krassian troopers, dead shadik raiders, all twisted and wrapped under and over each other in an orgiastic celebration of feral murder. smoke plumes drifted out from some las-punctures where uniform fabric had started to burn. fountains of blood had splashed up the wall and step in some places. in others, grenades had rendered bodies down into abattoir chunks, and scorched the earth walls black with soot. where they stepped, the duckboards sank and bright pools of blood welled up through the slats. the smell was truly nauseating. blood, cordite, offal, sweat, fyceline, faeces. all the ghosts had seen war before, to a greater or lesser extent, but this sight stung them. so many bodies, packed in so tight, into such a hide space. gak! corbec looked up at the backs of his boys on the step and struggled to rise out of the warm layers of bodies. he got his left hand on a timber support and� he froze. the grenade spoon tumbled from his clawing hand. he'd dropped the fething bomb. he looked down, looked down into twisted limbs and staring faces and spools of steaming guts. it was down there somewhere. if he cried out a warning, he knew his squad would break and the assaulters would be all over them. if he didn't he and most likely two or three of his team would be killed. corbec howled, lunging his hand down into the sticky mess of burst viscera, exposed bone and burnt fabric beneath him. he groped for the grenade. of all the stupid fething ways of dying. how long had the fuse been set to? ten seconds? fifteen? how long had he been scrabbling for it? his fingers closed on the bomb. it felt red-hot, toxic, and he wanted to let it go. but he daren't. he yanked it up and threw it. threw it as hard as his big, tired, old arm could manage. threw it up and out hoping it would fly all the way to the republic of shadik and never come back. threw it as desperately as he'd thrown the sewn-leather batter-balls that had come his way across the rec-field at pryze county ground when he'd been just eleven and detesting his forced participation in the county scholam tournament. he'd hated batter-ball. he'd never been able to catch. never been able to field. he screamed, and threw. threw hard. the best throw of his life. the hurtling bomb went off in the air, three metres up, as it spun into no-man's land. shrapnel from the airburst caught five of the raiders at the heart of the attacking platoon. they broke and fell back, shots from mkvenner, cown, veddekin and rerval punishing them further. veddekin hit one in the back as he ran away and ignited the poor bastard's ammo web. the retreating figure caught fire in a flash and carried on running, burning, jolting erratically over shell holes and mud-ridges until he dropped out of sight. corbec asked, on his feet again. his voice was hoarse with stress. he prayed to every pantheon imaginable that no one had noticed how fething close he'd come to screwing up. especially mkvenner. corbec was meant to be top dog. mkvenner would never have screwed up like that, not in a million years. and mkvenner would most certainly have picked corbec last for his ball team. old and tired and slow, colm corbec, old and tired and slow. corbec beckoned them after him and advanced up the jink-cut communications trench. he led the way now, his officer's pistol holstered and his rifle pulled off his back. he'd fixed his bayonet. there were more bodies up the communications cut, krassians most of them, distinguished by their coppercoloured coats and grey helmets. rerval recognised a face or two from ouranberg. poor fething bastards. they'd fought to hold every miserable centimetre of this arbitrary hole in the ground. the way some of them had died beggared belief. the suffering, the indignity� they were four zags down when corbec stopped them. small-arms fire was whizzing back and forth along the next angled stretch. probably lost a lot themselves on the way. so we're coming in behind them. let's make it count. on corbec's signal, they came round the zag-end and onto the backs of a pack of shadik raiders clustered in at the next turn. corbec yelled, firing on full auto, smacking las-shots into khaki backs. veddekin fell back, his weapon jammed. rerval pushed past him, and maintained the tight line. tube-charges wobbled through the air above them, hurled by sillo and cown from behind the trench turn. corbec shouted, and, without further warning, charged the enemy. he'd charged because he'd spotted that their angle wasn't secure. not by a long way. a secondary trench, probably a munitions track, intersected with their stretch from the right on a dog-leg. if there were more shadik up there� there were. corbec crunched his bayonet into the ribs of one of the shadik, then kicked the man off the blade as he turned to shoot another raider behind the first. somehow the first shadik managed to wrench corbec's blade off his gun as he went down. as a third came in, swinging a trench club with an iron head, corbec speared him with his lasrifle anyway. for all he bemoaned his age and diminishing strength, corbec was still one of the biggest, strongest men in the first. bayonet or no bayonet, you didn't get up again if colm corbec put his weight behind the steel muzzle of a lasgun and rammed it into your sternum. now corbec had an angle into the secondary trench. it was narrow and well-boarded, and sloped away from him downhill in a slight incline. he dropped to his knees and fired down it. his shots hit two of the enemy bunched up fifteen metres away, then a third. a fourth returned fire with a compact sub-autogun, a little bull-nosed slugger with a hooked magazine obviously designed with trench-war in mind. the burst of small-calibre bullets ripped into the support palings of the trench gabion behind corbec, showering out splinters. corbec fired twice, unruffled, and knocked the shooter off his feet and sideways into the revetment. the man slithered down and rolled over. there were other figures deeper in the secondary trench, veiled by the shadows and the smoke. corbec fired on them a couple more times, and then ducked back into cover as a ball bomb landed near the mouth of the secondary and threw mud and broken duckboards into the air. corbec took stock. he, mkvenner and rerval were on one side of the secondary's opening, the rest still back at the start of the zag. cown tried to dart across to them, but jerked back when rifle rounds and what seemed to be buckshot came stinging up the munitions track. corbec looked up the zag.  his squad had cleared out the raiders right up to the next rum, about ten metres away. mkvenner nodded and grinned. he got to the end and peered round. he hollered. more las-shots. the krassians, a new outfit with comparatively hide battlefield experience, had taken a pounding in the last forty-five minutes. they were spooked and angry and shooting at anything. rerval joined mkvenner. he pulled out his flare pistol, broke it open, and began sorting through his satchel of smoke and colour pellets. he knew full well rerval knew that. rerval was vox-ops, up there with beltayn and rafflan as one of the best signals specialists in the regiment. the question had been rerval's way of stress management. a coping strategy. guard! we're guard here! hold fire! fifteen metres back around the zag, corbec was negotiating the clearance of the secondary trench. along with cown, veddekin and ponore, he'd been squirting off shots down the length of it on a regular basis, but the response was firm. the worst part of it was that at least one of the raiders had a shotgun, probably a sawn-off, an ideal weapon for trench fights. ducking in and risking a bullet was one thing, and murten. feygor would probably give you odds on it. but a shotgun blanketed the space. sillo had found that out. ponore had dragged him back from the junction and dressed his wound, but corbec knew a scatter-shot hit like that was gangrene waiting to happen, even if the enemy hadn't treated their lead with bacterials as he'd known to be the tactics amongst the arch-enemy. sillo had been hit in the left thigh with such force it had shredded his trouser-leg off, broken his belt, and gouged the flesh so deeply corbec had seen yellow fat and bone. sillo had screamed, passed out, then woken again screaming. might be. well, they were fething scouts, the best of our best, half a century younger than me and tough enough to crack nalnuts in their armpits, corbec wanted to say. but he bit it back. cown was only trying to help. he picked up a shadik helmet, hung it on the nose of his las and hefted it up above the revet. he only had to wiggle it for a second before a rifle round cracked it and sent it spinning away into the air. cown smiled at corbec feebly, and shrugged. get those drums out. careful, mind. ponore unplugged the first drum and then tipped it over with veddekin's help. clear, sweet-smelling lamp oil glugged out, swirling down the makeshift trough. corbec realised he was fidgeting from foot to foot. he so wanted to be on the other side of the junction, mucking in with the work, but he could only stand and issue instructions. a sudden thought hit him. an epiphany. that's what it was called. he'd heard captain daur talk about epiphanies. daur was an educated lad. he understood these fine, subtle things. a moment of unexpected clarity. that's what corbec believed it to mean. a sudden revelatory instant of comprehension. he should never have become an officer. never. not even a sergeant, let alone xo of the tanith regiment. sure, he had the presence and the charisma, so he was told. he was a personality, and the men rallied round him. that was what gaunt had seen in him, first time they'd met. must've been. and corbec was happy to serve. but there it was. gaunt had made him colonel. he'd not asked for it. he'd not chased for it. he wasn't a career man, like daur or, emperor protect them all, rawne. he had no ambition. what was it they all said about him? that compliment? he led from the front. just so. he was never happier than when he was at the very workface of fighting, confronting the practicals. he was the big, strong son of a machinesmith from county pryze. he should have been a trooper, a dog-grunt, fething well mucking in. mucking in over there, in fact. not standing this side of the junction, yakking out orders. cown hissed. the vox trooper hurried down to corbec. rerval said, handing over the fat-nosed signal gun. red, i guess, chief. it's got the biggest powder charge. but we're only supposed to thump one of them out in predicaments. rerval shrugged and handed corbec a red-tabbed cartridge. he asked cown. the ghosts on the other side had rolled the last drum away. fire in the hole! superheated, glowing like a laser torpedo, it ricocheted off the right-hand wall, tumbled left, bounced off a druber post and went spinning away towards the cowering shadik raiders, kicking off streams of bright red smoke. corbec pulled rerval back against the side wall of the zag. there was a distant yell. a cramp of ignition. then forty metres of the secondary trench went off like a earner's kiss. fire leapt up into the sky, clearing the tops of the walls. thick, intense, sweet-smelling like the wick-burn of the little lamps they'd given them. then there was another smell. a terrible smell. good fething job. in the dim lamp-light, he sat down at the little raw-wood table.  the brass message shell was sitting there, on end, casting a little blunt shadow. there was no sign of the scrap of blue paper. soric breathed slowly, clutching the edge of the table tightly with his gnarled hands. a drink. that might help. he got up, and waddled his stiff leg over to the shelf. gaunt had said he'd have men shot for drinking on duty. except in special cases. this was a special case. soric unstoppered the flask with hands that were quaking more than he'd have liked them to. he took a slug of sacra. good old bragg had supplied him with the stuff. soric had developed a taste for the tanith liquor. who'd get him sacra now bragg was gone? the blue-paper despatch pad lay on the shelf beside the flask. soric thought about picking it up, then took another swig instead. the grain alcohol burned in his belly. he felt better. he looked at the pad again. the first two sheets were missing. soric glanced over at the table. hark entered. soric felt hugely exposed. he tried to keep his mouth clamped shut so he wouldn't exude the smell of liquor. gaunt might have forgiven him. hark was a different matter. hark was a commissar, unqualified, unalloyed. hark asked. he seemed suspicious. hark looked at him. mouth clamped shut soric grinned and shrugged. soric realised he hadn't noticed. tough stuff around 293 and 294, and also with criid, obel and theiss. yeah, it's too bad. good soldier. but his section took seventy per cent losses. shells caught them hard. lasko, fewtin, bisroya, mkdil. all gone. hark gestured expansively. hark nodded. he rattled round on the shelf. hark knocked back the shot. soric sipped his own. he refilled hark's glass and breathed more naturally. hark got up. soric sat down hard as soon as the commissar had gone. he played with his shot glass, and then finished the dregs. commissar hark is coming. � colm corbec, colonel it had been a bad day at the front. the tanith first reserves at rhonforq could tell that just from the false dusk caused by the wall of black smoke rising in the distance. they waited for news, hoping for good, steeled for bad. gaunt had left captain ban daur in command of the first's reserve section, a full two-thirds of the regiment's strength, and daur fretted miserably throughout the afternoon. every ten, twenty minutes he wandered outside and watched the flickering lights and puffing smogs of the distant battle. at first, the thump of the shells had been like the thunder of a distant storm; muffled, remote, lagging behind the flashes. then the sound had become continuous, without break or breath or pause. a constant rumble, as if the earth was slowly faulting and tearing. sometimes, the ground shook, even this far away. once in a while, there came a blast roar so loud and plangent that it rose out of the rumble. daur couldn't work out if these noises came from shells that had landed closer to his position, or bigger shells landing with the rest. they'd been told the enemy had brought up some big-reach, huge calibre weapons. daur tried to occupy himself, but the rumble was too distracting. at around 14.00, he went to eat at one of the pensions, and got a curious look from the matronly owner when he ordered scrambled eggs. only when it arrived did he remember that he'd already taken lunch � scrambled eggs � just an hour before. he thought of visiting zweil. the unit's chaplain was refreshing company sometimes, and good at distracting a man's mind with provocative conversation. but he was told that zweil had gone to the front that morning with gaunt, as if he'd known he'd be needed today. daur toured the billets instead. the ghosts had occupied the stableblocks and barns of a pair of farmsteads in the south of the town, their overspill camped out in a sea of tents pitched in the paddocks behind. daur wandered into the muddy yard of one of the stable-blocks. burone, bray and ewler had taken the long, lefthand bam for their platoons. the men mostly lurked around, dejected in the light rain, like prisoners of war in a blockhouse pen. daur saw the coals of burning lho-sticks in the shadows of the high-loft hatches. under the slope of a lean-to roof, polio from seven platoon was trying to teach card tricks to a crowd of onlookers.  polio had been bodyguard for a noble house back on verghast, and his nerves were augmented by extravagantly expensive neural enhancers, so his fingers split and spread the cards faster than the eye could follow. it was a little piece of magic to watch, and the men around him were captivated. daur watched for a little while, until polio had exhausted his repertoire of tricks and produced three cups and a shell case instead. the audience groaned. polio asked, his hands circling the upturned cups in a blur. he caught daur's eye and winked. polio grinned. at the back end of the yard, haller's men were kicking a ball around with some of the krassians. it was a lively, muddy game. noa vadim was running circles around the krassians, his squad mates urging him on. daur was sure they were really shouting and whooping to shut out the distant growl of the battle. daur heard low-level gunfire coming from one of the stable pens and went to investigate. he found trooper merrt practising his aim against old bottles ranged on the crossbeams of the end wall. gn� gn � sorry. no, captain. i'm just always amused the way you verghasts refer to vervunhive as �the war', capital emphasis and all. it was a big do, certainly, and hard as fething bastardy for everyone involved. but it wasn't �the war'. the war's what we're fighting now. we were fighting it before verghast and we'll be fighting it still in years to come. all the tanith did that. to them, it was a contraction. to verghastites, it was insulting slang. rawne was meryn's mentor now, and meryn was learning well. the freshfaced attitude had vanished, and been replaced by a bitter, hostile air. the stain of rawne's corrosive influence, daur believed. rawne was grooming meryn. unofficially, the rumour was that meryn had ordered, or performed, some excessively brutal actions during operation larisel. certainly larkin and mkvenner were tight-lipped about him. meryn had been zealous to achieve his larisel mission targets and prove himself for promotion. too zealous, maybe. meryn made a sarcastic gesture at the smoke rising from the front. but i'm a realist. that's bad feth up there. � the war', you know? someone's going to get hurt. the two novice sergeants walked away down the bank towards the village and the tower of the chapel st avigns. as soon as they were out of earshot, daur turned on meryn. varl was declaiming from the wooden loading dock above the pit. he lofted one of the birds by the scruff of its neck, expertly avoiding its clacking blade of a beak and its windmilling, clawed feet. expertly, that was the word. daur chuckled. varl bantered. the ghosts in the crowd laughed at this. varl grabbed one of the bird's pistoning feet and splayed the vicious claws for the crowd to admire. varl replied, looking over and swinging the squirming struthid round. the bird lunged and cracked the case in two with its scissoring beak. the crowd roared. brostin retrieved the broken parts and threw them into the press. men huddled and fought for them. called daur. varl's smile returned. daur saw baen, mkfeyd, ifvan and rafflan moving through the crowd, collecting cash and quoting odds. �against mighty ibram here! redjacq indeed! howled a krassian. daur peered through the crowd to identify the source of the voice. it was mkoll. the chief scout was standing, arms folded, in the middle of the frenzy. cried one of the kottmarkers. gendemen! daur blinked. an extraordinary thing happened. there was a ripple of thuds, and a semi-circle of tanith blades appeared around varl's feet, tips buried in the wood, thrown without hesitation and with complete accuracy from the crowd. varl bent down and plucked out one of the still vibrating blades. let's clear out and get ready for kit inspection! dorden called. the lean orderly ran up. lesp paused as he prepared to dash off again. dorden handed him a small paper packet. curth broke open a box of anti-bacterial gel packed in fat metal tubes and passed them around. the triage station was a collection of dirty, long-frame tents pitched to the west of a dead woodland. the access ramps into the first dugouts of the 55th sector workings began just fifty metres east of them. they were terribly exposed, the first above-ground features this side of the peinforq line. the wood � hambley wood, apparently � was proof of their vulnerability. it was a sea of soft mud and old craters, stubbled with the burnt stumps of thousands of trees. the whole area smelled of wet-rot and mulch. the first's medicae team shared the station with a krassian detail and a gang of alliance corpsmen. when curth went outside the ghosts' tent for a final lho-stick before the real work began, she was surprised and disgusted at the filthy state of the locals. their scrubs and � worse �their hands, were soiled. many were ill. some were intoxicated, probably from drinking neat rubbing alcohol. foskin, the most junior orderly, joined her for a smoke. it was nothing like that simple. the bodies and the walking wounded that began to pass back to the triage station were so drenched in mud it was impossible to distinguish rank or regiment or even gender. curth spent five minutes sewing up a thigh wound before she realised it was flame-trooper lubba she was treating. one of kolea's old mob, from nine platoon. she rinsed his face and smiled when the tattoos were revealed. ana curth was the only person in the first who knew the secret. kolea had known, but it had been lost along with his identity. there was a madam called aleksa who knew too, but curth hadn't seen her since phantine. he'd presumed them lost. when he'd found out they were alive after all, it was too late. orphans, they'd bonded with criid. it was too late to wreck their world again. that's what kolea had believed anyway, before injury had robbed them of his character. curth felt it was her responsibility to watch over them all.  the anonymous wounded plodded in, through the late afternoon. dorden found cases of shrapnel wounding, concussive damage and several chronic examples of harm done by gas, both caustic and lachrymatory. he extracted a five centimetre piece of hand-bomb casing from dafelbe's jaw, twenty-two nails from the foot and leg of trooper charel, and a broken length of bayonet from the ribcage of jessi banda. lesp shook his head. dorden asked. banda had passed out. some of the most terribly wounded came from sixteen platoon, though there weren't many of them. maroy's dead. don't! imperial supplies! this stuff is stamped for use by the first-and-only! you bastards! growled an aexegarian. dorden cried as he came over. he'd seen this kind of despair-induced corruption too many times before. the alliance was running painfully short of essential supplies. a big shipment of fresh medical goods must have seemed too choice a treasure to ignore. he'd get some more, he'd get some more shipped in from the munitorium vessels. it wasn't worth confronting these miserable, desperate wretches. curth exclaimed, and tried to gather up some of the cartons. a thuggish alliance trooper with a dirty bandage around his head struck out at her, and knocked her over into the mud. the cartons went flying. dorden yelled and leapt at the alliance orderlies, pulling them back off the fallen curth, who was hunched in a foetal position in the mud to protect herself from their toecaps. they turned on him. one punched him in the mouth, another kicked him in the hip. dorden yelped, and then threw a jab that laid one of the aexegarians out. then they really started to pound on him. curth got up and threw herself back into the fray, clawing and punching and kicking. a bolt-round went off, very loud in the close air. the brawling figures broke away from curth and dorden at the sound. ibram gaunt walked across the muck, white smoke escaping through the vents of his bolt pistol's flash retarder. he was splashed from head to toe in mud and blood, and powder burns marked his cheeks. gaunt lowered his weapon and shot two of the aexegarians dead where they stood. the rest fled. for good measure, gaunt sighted and shot down one of the escapees too. guardsmen, medics and aexe personnel all around the field station stood and gawped in shock. curth looked at him in frank fear. she'd never seen him like this. gaunt looked away. gaunt could tell he was more angry than hurt. angry that the fight had started at all, angry that he'd been stupid enough to get involved. and more than anything else, angry at the way gaunt had just demonstrated the bleak side of imperial guard discipline. dorden had vowed never to kill. he'd broken that vow once, on menazoid epsilon, in order to save gaunt's life. gaunt said. gaunt's arrival had marked a fresh influx of casualties, the majority of them krassians and alliance, but also a good number from at least seven ghost platoons, including those of rawne, domor, theiss and obel. the injuries in theiss' and obels' units were mainly from shells. some of these wounds, like trooper kell's, were devastating. others were insidious. trooper tokar would be the first tanith man to have to learn as a necessity the sign language used by previously blast-deafened verghastites. in domor's platoon, and in rawne's, the injuries were from close-quarters fighting. milo, unharmed himself apart from a few bruises, carried in trooper nehn, who'd had his skull cracked by a trench club. trooper osket had lost an eye, and then had suffered the misfortune of grabbing a bayonet thrust at him. the blade had chopped in between his middle and third finger, right down through the palm to the base of the thumb. corporal chiria, one of the verghastite girls in domor's outfit, had massive lacerations that would scar her plain but cheerful face forever. rawne was unconscious. feygor and ledan carried him in on an improvised stretcher made of duckboards. dorden said, examining the gunshot. jessi banda's going to live. it was touch and go. leclan sagged visibly with relief. feygor asked. the involuntary sarcasm injected into his voice by his augmetic throat made dorden snort. beltayn looked up and saw gaunt. they were alone at the edge of the triage station, by the side of the trackway where long grass bushed out from broken fence posts. the sun had begun to come out its light turned sooty by the vapour of war. a train of stretcher bearers went past, heading west. gaunt sat down on the grass bank, and beltayn resumed his seat on the old hopper. beltayn produced a data-slate. rawne had once joked, bleakly, that the tanith spared gaunt that one grim responsibility of commanding officers everywhere, the letter home. in truth, few guard cos bothered to inform next of kin, though a handful of regiments were famous for the scrupulous way they did it. gaunt had no one to write to, even if he'd felt the inclination. tanith was gone, and most of the verghastites who'd joined the ghosts had done so because they were leaving no one behind. gaunt remembered the old days, when oktar had charged him with composing the lia notices for the families of the hyrkan dead. after balhaut, it had taken him the best part of a week. from the list, he realised that the ghosts' strength had dropped to less than one hundred platoons for the first time since verghast. he felt his anger returning. war consumed manpower. that was one of the first things they drummed into you at the commissariate. but this war� this war consumed manpower like a glutton. gaunt asked. as his adjutant began to set up his vox-caster, gaunt got to his feet, and wandered a little way down the track. columns of aexe alliance foot soldiers were moving towards him from the reserves, weary and dirty. more bodies for the war machine. he was out of breath. he'd been jogging all the way from rhonforq. and you're here? the vox was down. daur looked away, gazing across the neglected fields and the withered woodlands. but i want to go easier on him. he's had a rough time these past eighteen months. daur registered a certain pride. for the first time it would be gaunt and a verghastite in command at the sharp end. it felt like a coming of age. but his feelings were mixed. rawne wounded, corbec pulled back� would the ghosts still be ghosts without them? when he first signed up, at the act of consolation, daur had imagined a time when he'd be gaunt's xo. he'd all but willed death on rawne and corbec so that he could bring the verghast strength to the fore. so badly, he wanted to tell corbec about cuu. cuu the maniac. cuu the psycho. cuu, who would have killed him but for the sudden shelling. cuu, who had killed bragg. but now it seemed pointless. loglas, the only witness, was very dead. if larkin brought a charge, it would be cuu's word against his. and cuu had proved to be bulletproof up till now. larkin knew colm would take him seriously. but he also knew that colm was hidebound by the rules. as soon as the shells started to fall, cuu had fled, leaving larkin alone.  larkin had been so terrified, arms up over his head, eyes closed, it had taken him a moment to realise cuu had actually gone and only larkin's fear of cuu was left behind. no, there was no point, larkin decided. the only way to be free from his fear was to face it. corbec couldn't help him. gaunt couldn't. the system couldn't. lijah cuu had to die. it was that simple. cuu wanted the score settled, didn't he? so it would be settled. fething straight, sure as sure, one way or another. corbec said. that was true, but it was also a lie. that wasn't why larkin was most upset. but it was all corbec needed to know. �colonel ankre that night, and the morning that followed , it was mercifully quiet in 55th sector. it was as if the tide of war had drawn out from that part of the line, slack, low. it was flood tide elsewhere. further south down the naeme valley, the 47th and 46th sectors were brutalised by twelve straight hours of heavy bombardment. a considerable stretch of the so-called seronne line, which ran east from the end of the peinforq sectors right across country to the kottmark massif, came under shellfire, and then armoured assault. the worst clashes were just south of the vostl delta. to the north, there were intermittent light attacks and raids all through the night at loncort and the salient. unconfirmed reports were circulating that sectors north of gibsgatte had endured the biggest offensive of the year, and that battle still raged there. the morning was damp and fog-bound. with beltayn his only companion, gaunt travelled north for meiseq. beltayn said little. he could tell gaunt was in a foul temper, and didn't want to provoke anything. a staff car conveyed them as far as ongche, where they boarded a despatch train bound for the north. the train was half-empty, and rattled along through misty farmland and rain-swept heath. prior to departure, just after dawn, gaunt had made a final inspection of the first's positions. daur's relief squads were at the front by then, though corbec was to remain as line xo until gaunt's return. at the end of his tour, gaunt had made a call at the military hospital in rhonforq, spending time with the injured and looking in on the critical cases. rawne had survived the night though he'd required secondary surgery in the small hours to staunch internal bleeding. dorden was so fatigued by then he seemed almost asleep on his feet and the bruises he'd taken in the beating were starting to nag at him. gaunt had been intending to ask the chief medic to accompany him to meiseq, but one look at dorden stifled the idea. dorden was needed at rhonforq, if only to get some rest gaunt knew that dorden was still angry with him about the discipline killings. he had a right to be, in gaunt's opinion. gaunt had been in a dazed rage the afternoon before, weary with the pointless losses he'd witnessed at station 289. he'd just snapped. as an imperial commissar, gaunt was unusual, quite apart from the fact that he held command rank. commissars were universally feared. they were the guard's instruments of discipline and control, the lash that kept the soldiery in line and drove them forward. they were there to drum the tenets of the imperial creed into the minds of the enlisted men, and then give them stark, regular reminders of that truth. summary execution, even for minor violations, was acceptable stock-in-trade for a commissar. the great yarrick himself had once said that it was a commissar's job to be a figure of greater fear and threat to an imperial guardsman than any enemy. that was not gaunt's way. experience had shown him that morale was better served by encouragement and trust than by an unpredictable temper and a pistol. he'd had a good example in the form of his mentor, the late delane oktar. oktar's philosophy of morale had been based on trust and tolerance too. there had been times when a firm hand had been called for, a few more when action had worked better than words. but gaunt prided himself on his fairness, and knew that he was able to count men like dorden as friends because of it. at the field hospital, he'd acted just like a typical commissar. dorden hadn't said anything, but gaunt had seen the disappointment in his eyes. as the train rattled north, he turned the incident over in his mind. there was no point setting the blame on fatigue. fatigue implied weakness, and a commissar could never be weak. he realised it was more a matter of futility. he'd come into the aexe war with reservations, and each step of the way to the front had confirmed his fears. war was not senseless of itself. faced with the immortal obscenity of chaos, humankind had a true cause to rally around and fight for. there was a greater good, a purpose, even here on aexe. it was the manner of this war that was senseless. the dismissive contempt with which the alliance threw men and materiel at the enemy. the antique thinking that believed brute strength was the main determining factor behind victory. it made gaunt angry to see this, angrier still to have the first caught up in it. the afternoon before, he'd been smothered by the futility, and it had worked its ministry on him. outside, the world went by. one world, just one of thousands, hundreds of thousands, that combined to form the greatest achievement in human history. the imperium of mankind. many believed that the imperium was so vast in scale, so huge in scope, that the actions of one man could not affect it. that wasn't true. if everyone thought that way, the imperium would simply collapse in upon itself overnight each and every human soul determined their part of imperial culture. that was the only thing the emperor asked of a man. be true to yourself, and all those myriad tiny contributions would combine to build a culture that could endure until the stars went out. beltayn was asleep, his head nodding onto his chest, his bandaged hand cradled in the other. beyond the window pane, broken woodland flickered by, cut by hillsides dark with rain. a stream flashed like a drawn sword. meadows lay invisible beneath cloaks of white mist. uplands broke through fog like the tips of grey reefs. a lone, lightning-scarred tree stood vigil on a bare hill. a village slumbered, derelict. clouds as thick as ruffled taffeta chased each other across the sky. gaunt woke from a recurring dream about balhaut, and realised the train had stopped. the rain drummed down and gloomy woodlands surrounded the carriage windows. he checked his timepiece: an hour past noon. they should be in chossene by now. he got up and walked down the empty carriage to the door. opening the window, he smelt the damp undergrowth and soil of the wood, and heard birdcalls and the batter of rain on the leaves. other passengers were peering out. down at the locomotive, engineers had dismounted. gaunt opened the door and jumped down onto the overgrown track side. the locomotive had broken down, one of the engineers told him. repairs were beyond them. they were going to have to wait until a relief tender could come out from chossene. gaunt asked. meiseq's still a good way away. we walk. beltayn added. well, maybe this was a bad welcome here. there is no need for obeisance. beltayn groaned quietly. she smiled a little. beltayn asked warily. she turned her head towards the sound of his voice. another careful aim. beltayn stepped back slightly as if he had been target-acquired. with her head turned, gaunt could see the long, pink line of the scar that ran over the top of her skull, seaming her white hair like a plough-furrow through com, down to the left side base of her neck. he sighed inwardly. he'd almost been taken in by her talk. he'd been on the verge of believing they had stumbled upon � or been fatefully drawn to � a prophetic being. but now everything, even her peculiarly apt references to milo, took on another meaning. she was mad. brain-damaged in some long-ago action. rambling, talking at shadows, deprived of contact by her lonely vigil. gaunt needed to get on. gaunt sat beside her on the pew. rambling though she was, sister zaker was doing him a favour, so he could at least humour her for a minute or two. he could smell the flower-scent again. where had he smelled that before? herodor? gaunt echoed. he didn't really want to get drawn into this. she paused and turned her head towards him. gaunt retreated down the aisle. outside, in the damp trackway, beltayn sat behind the wheel of a massive old limousine. its night-blue body was chipped with rust and lichen caked its running boards. weeds had sprouted from the grille and fender. beltayn had turned on the headlamps, which burned like the eyes of a nocturnal predator. gaunt walked up to the car and ran his hand along the grey hide of the retractable roof. beltayn fiddled with the dashboard controls. with a creak, the hood redacted on concertinaing iron hoops so that the car was open-topped. gaunt got into the back. beltayn looked back at him and raised his bandaged hand in a rather pathetic gesture. they roared away down the woodland lane, leaving the chapel behind. a drove road brought them through veniq, and then on across open arable tracts to shonsamarl where they joined the northern highway. southbound, the highway was thick with munition trains and troop carriers. northbound, they caught the end of a convoy of guard thunderers and light armour moving up to gibsgatte. they played leapfrog up the line of heavy tanks as well as the passing traffic would allow, until the convoy turned off at chossene, and then they raced on over the naeme viaduct and into the cornfield flats of loncort county. fitful light rain and patchy sun followed them through the afternoon along metalled roads that lay like ribbons over the salty-green fields. they saw slow formations of alliance tri-planes buzzing east towards the front, and once or twice the glint of imperial air support banging in supersonically, taking a new kind of war to this lingering, oldfashioned theatre. shortly before 18.00, gaunt saw the skyline of meiseq rising over the fields. meiseq was a new town built on old roots. it had been almost entirely razed in the early years of the aexe war, when the initial shadik advance had sliced mercilessly right across country to the upper naeme.  five years of counterfighting, focused especially on the battle of diem, had eventually ousted the enemy from a portion of territory marked in the north-west corner by the city of gibsgatte and in the south-east by loncort. to the south, from loncort, ran the peinforq line that held the naeme valley. to the north ran the hotly contested sectors beyond gibsgatte. the alliance considered the box so sound it had turned the areas around diem into a memorial park for the fallen. an eternal flame burned at the site of diem's cathedral, and the oceans of grass around it were lined with row upon row of white, obcordate grave markers. meiseq had been rebuilt. its buildings were made from pressure treated wood-pulp, coated with an emulsion of rock cement. it perched on an escarpment above a bend in the upper naeme, encircled by pales of timber and flakboard. at its centre rose the wooden cathedral of san jeval. it was getting dark by the time they drove up through the fortress gate in the south face of the walls and entered the town. the cathedral bells were ringing, and lamplighters were igniting the caged chemical torches that lined the streets. meiseq reminded gaunt of a frontier city. its prefabricated bulk smelled new and entirely at odds with the old, stone-built population centres he'd experienced so far on aexe. it was strategically important, and wanted visitors to know that, but it seemed little more than a camp, an earthwork. the air smelled of roofing pitch and sweating wood. he remembered moving in to occupy rakerville, years ago, with the hyrkans. that had smelled the same. an outpost. a brief statement of imperial activity. a gesture made without confidence at a frontier. they parked near to the cathedral in a yard surrounded by trees. the trees were old and withered, but the aexegarians who had remade meiseq had remade the trees too, grafting new boughs onto the old trunks shattered by war. late blossom and fresh green growth formed a roof over the gnarled, grey trunks. gaunt and beltayn walked down the neighbouring streets, through the light crowds, and found the military hall, a grim, twin-towered edifice with a walled precinct of its own. it was nearly 20.00 hours. washed and changed, gaunt left beltayn in the officio suite appointed to him, and went down to dinner. his guides were two subalterns of the bande sezari, dignified in their plumed head-dresses and green silks. night had fallen, and the narrow passages of the military hall were caves of fluttering rushlights. the dinner had just begun in a terrace room overlooking the river to the west. the last scraps of day-fade smudged the sky outside, and drum-fires flickered along the low river bend. there were nineteen officers present and all stood briefly as gaunt took his place at the empty twentieth place. he sat and the mumble of conversation resumed. the long table was dressed in white cloth, and lit by four large candelabra. gaunt's place setting twinkled with nine separate pieces of cutlery. he saw golke nearby, and lord general van voytz at the head of the table. he didn't recognise any other faces, except for van voytz's chief tactician, biota. like ortern, all the others were senior alliance officers, either aexegarians or kottmarkers. gaunt began to feel like he'd walked into a lion's den. he'd assumed van voytz had summoned him to attend a private dinner where he could voice his disquiet at alliance tactics in the company of chosen staff chiefs. he hadn't expected this, a full, high brass banquet. though van voytz, imposing in his dark green dress uniform, dominated the head of the table, the presiding influence seemed to come from the man to van voytz's left, a bullish kottmark general with a disturbingly bland, pale face, half-moon clerk's spectacles and white-blond hair. gaunt said little, and ate quietly, catching the conversation strands as they cut back and forth along the table. there were a lot of thinly veiled, disrespectful remarks about imperial soldiery, which gaunt felt were entirely for his benefit. the alliance staff were goading him, seeing what they could get away with, seeing what would make him comment. three courses came and went, including the main course of braised game, and were followed by a sticky, oversweet pudding called sonso that the alliance officers greeted with much approval. it was a local speciality. ortern, and some of the others nearby, extolled its virtues. to gaunt, it was almost unbearably sugared. he left a good deal of it. the stewards cleared the tables, brushed off the cloth, and served sweet black caffeine and amasec in large, green-glass balloons. the locals, who had all dined with their pressed white napkins tucked into the buttons of their dress frocks like bibs, now tossed the loose ends over their left shoulders, apparently a custom that showed they were finished. gaunt folded his own loosely and left it on his setting. a tiny servitor drone circled the table, clipping and lighting cigars. one of the kottmarkers pushed his chair back and started to smoke a long-stemmed flute-pipe with a water bowl. ortern offered gaunt a fat, loose-rolled cigar, which he declined. ortern chuckled. lyntor-sewq's right hand man, then. martane smiled blandly at gaunt and sipped his amasec delicately. van voytz cut in, good humouredly. van voytz's face darkened. it was a tremendous but subtle slight. martane was deferring to van voytz, but doing so in such a way that suggested the imperials took the aexe struggle far less seriously than the locals. the conversation stilled. it was a duel, no more or less, verbal but still vicious. imperials versus alliance. martane's remark had been cutting and poised, allowing van voytz two options: pass over it and take the put-down, or trigger a more obvious clash by marking it. either way, van voytz would lose grace. now gaunt had stepped up and deflected the slur as deftly as martane had made it. gaunt saw van voytz disguise a smile. there was a word that usually followed a remark like gaunt's latest. there was another comment that seemed light and warm yet had sharp steel running through it. martane was more direct now. he clearly felt he had gaunt on the back foot and was about to force him into damning himself. gaunt saw golke across the table. the man was impassive. gaunt recalled clearly how direct and brutal he'd been with golke at rhonforq, ankre too. he could tell golke was willing him not to be similarly forthright now. as if i'd be that stupid, gaunt thought to himself. martane caught the eyes of some of his fellow officers slyly. gaunt saw van voytz ever so slightly shake his head. martane's pale cheeks flushed briefly as red as the first course soup. behind a guard of honesty, gaunt had just outstepped him. martane fumbled. voices rambled round the table. many of the officers were embarrassed by their commander's comment. gaunt smiled to himself. as with war, so with decorum, aexe was so old-fashioned. he remembered some of the staff dinners when imperial commanders had hurled abuse at each other across the table and then sat laughing over the port. there was no such frankness here. there was simply a culture of martial formality that stifled any hope of victory. servitors adjusted the lamps, refreshed drinks and then left them alone. van voytz sat down in a large padded armchair by the fireplace, and took a book at random off the nearest shelf. the look that told me he saw you imperials as brand new toys� toys that he would use in just the same way as the old ones. i had hoped that the alliance might learn things from the guard� new ways of fighting� things like fluid field orders and unit-level decision making� golke nodded. biota looked around at them. dawn fog from the upper naeme shrouded meiseq the next morning when gaunt rose. he had made sure beltayn woke him early for the return trip to rhonforq. while he was shaving in the cold, new light, a messenger arrived and asked him to attend lord general van voytz. van voytz was taking breakfast in his staff apartments, along with biota and a small group of aides. at van voytz's instruction, a steward brought caffeine and fried fish and egg mash for gaunt, so he could eat with them. van voytz said, eating heartily. he was dressed in an embroidered cape and a linen field suit of dark red. van voytz paused, chewing, and emptied his mouth. van voytz led gaunt out onto a verandah overlooking the river. the landscape below them was barred with chalky mist. front line. their job is to penetrate the shadik defences and locate� and maybe disable� these new super-siege guns. , gaunt walked out of the military hall into the meiseq sunlight. it was 08.30. imperial personnel threaded between the alliance sentries as they loaded van voytz's transports. gaunt looked around for beltayn and the car. he found only beltayn. beltayn grimaced. don't bother, let's not waste any more time. scare us up some transport� or at least get us tickets on the next southbound train. one of demarchese's fables. biota paused. all right. never mind. good luck at gibsgatte. may the emperor protect. � murtan feygor the forest beckoned. they could smell it. from ins arbor, coming off the transports, they could see it. rolled like green fur around the uplands east of them. big. silent. inscrutable. it wasn't as if the tanith hadn't seen forest since the founding. there'd been plenty. the thick rainwoods north of bhavnager, the tropical groves of monthax, the voltemand mirewoods. but there was something about this forest, something temperate, old and cool, that reminded them all achingly of the lost nalwoods. ins arbor was a shabby dump of a town, ill-supplied and stinking in the summer heat. there were no proper billets, virtually no water, and the worst rations they'd yet experienced. but morale had improved overnight. the forest beckoned. corbec could see the renewed spirit in the faces of the men around the camp. he sat back on the fender of a halftrack, and made a last few adjustments to squad lists he was drawing up. each ten-man detail needed a good mix of scouts and fireteam, and hark had requested corbec spread the scout-trainees evenly. corbec sucked on the big cigar smouldering between his teeth. a gift from gaunt. he'd been going to save it for a special occasion, but the smoke was doing a fine job of screening out the odour of the ins arbor latrines. gaunt's real gift had been this mission. half of the first taken out of the naeme meatgrinder and given something useful to do. that was what had lifted morale, despite the grim facilities of the staging town. anything was better than the line, and the prospect of forest work was better than anything. tanith were smiling.  verghastites, who had no special affinity with woodland, were smiling too, simply lifted by the mood and the last minute reprieve from trench postings. he called varl over and sent him to round up the troops for the first details. the forest beckoned. brostin kept going on about it. not the leaves. the smell of wet earth beneath trees. brostin shrugged and smiled, and picked up his sloshing fuel tanks again. cuu melted away into the bracken. feygor raised his right hand and swept the fingers round twice in a paddling motion. the members of nineteen detail fanned forward through the underbrush. it was late afternoon. the sun was a yellow dapple to the west behind the leaf cover. the glades of the forest were misty hollows pillared by black trunks. wild birds called aloud through the wood spaces, and the air smelled of damp bark, wood-poppy and beythorn. nineteen detail had been out now for three hours, having left the company command at ins arbor with the other details after corbec's briefing. on the hike up through the villages, the details had separated, one by one, each striking off towards their own designated patrol. nineteen had been ordered to sweep the bascuol valley as far as the pass road down to frergarten. two, maybe three days, out and back. they'd made decent time, moving in country. a gentle stroll into the woods. gutes shrugged. caffran nodded. he didn't begrudge brosrin's enthusiasm. these were dark pine woods, the nearest thing to tanith they'd experienced since the loss. the spark of recognition he himself had felt at the landing zones was magnified here. forest. trees. aexe cardinal felt enough like home to please him. the verghastites in the detail were less settled. muril and jajjo, children of the hive, were jumping at shadows, moving their weapons to cover every last mysterious creak and crack the forest made. mkvenner looked at feygor dourly. he had no love for rawne's adjutant. a speck of feth, if you pressed him for an opinion, and few dared. jajjo tumbled forward to join the lean, scary tanith scout. mkvenner and jajjo forked away ahead of the detail. feygor kept his eyes on them. he could still see jajjo's creeping, hunched shape after two minutes. mkvenner had vanished almost immediately. rerval made a vox-check to make sure they were still in range. he looked up and saw muril with a grim expression on her face. rerval shrugged. he knew what was bothering her. muril and jajjo had both signed up for scout training, and this tour in the woods was meant to be their proving ground. so far, only jajjo had benefited from mkvenner's expertise and tutoring. it's a female thing, rerval thought. just like rawne, though i'd never have expected that kind of prejudice from ven. they advanced, spread out, through the dim forest space: feygor, gutes, brostin, muril, caffran, cuu. cuu paused to look back at the tenth and final member of the detail. minimal effort, a little walk-and-look job, and open ended. and if they found somewhere nice, maybe an old farm or something, then a two-day patrol might turn itself into three or four days of r and r. he'd have preferred to pick his own detail. nineteen was a mixed bag, but brostin, rerval and gutes were okay , cuu had his moments, and caff was all right in his way. larks was a nut, but what else was new? he could shoot. maybe he'd bag them something for supper. feygor acknowledged to himself that he had no idea what sort of wildlife lived out here, but he was pretty sure there would be something with a mouth at one end, an arse at the other, and decent eating in between. the verghasts he could do without. jajjo was a stiff, and in feygor's opinion, no verghast was ever going to cut it as a scout. it wasn't in the genes. the girl was better. decorative. maybe he'd get really lucky and bag another kind of game out here in the wild woods. the real pain was ven. sure, feygor respected the scout, everyone did. but everyone was afraid of mkvenner too. he was straight as a die. feygor knew he'd have to plan very carefully if they were going to have any fun without ven getting in the way. of course, there was meant to be a job to do, too. the montorq forest covered upwards of three thousand square kilometres and ran down from the toyre, bearding the west-em flanks of the kottmark massif, a wall of mountains that split the eastern provinces of aexegary from kottmark. most of the montorq terrain was steep, thick woodland slopes, pretty much impassible unless you were on foot or had time to scout out a decent track. the shadik republic lay to the north. the nominal border was about eighty kilometres away, beyond the headwaters of the toyre. during the long years of the war, shadik had pressed aexegary and kottmark along all viable routes, gradually establishing the pattern of the front line. seen on a tactical map, the forest uplands were the one break in that line. west of them lay the seronne line, the naeme sectors and meiseq, tight as a drum. north and east, the so-called ostlund shield line that blocked the shadik thrusts into kottmark. shadik had never touched montorq. it had been spared the war because of geography. just a few hours' walking in the skirts of the forest showed how hard the going would be. only a fool would try and push an army through the forest. feygor had heard the republican commanders called a lot of things, but fool wasn't one of them. however, times change.  the alliance had become concerned with the idea that shadik was about to change tactics in an attempt to throw the deadlock. instead of directly assaulting frergarten, the alliance's great eastern bastion, they might push elite infantry with light support down through the montorq, and encircle frergarten, achieving by stealth where three previous assaults had failed. they could take frergarten, ins arbor, snap the seronne line and be marching into the eastern provinces in under six weeks. it was unlikely, but it was possible. the ghosts' orders were to assess enemy disposition and communication routes in the montorq area. to bring early warning, if necessary. and, corbec had suggested during the briefing, work out the feasibility of the alliance pulling the trick in reverse. by the autumn, maybe an alliance force would be heading through the forest, marching north� feygor didn't care. he didn't actually care who won, who lost. he wouldn't give a feth if the shadik president came along and took a dump in the high sezar's ear. just as long as feygor was left alone. he was tired. it had been a long fething road from tanith, and they'd been through plenty. rawne always said that gaunt led them like he had something to prove. well, they'd fething well proved it enough, hadn't they? it was some other bastard's turn. maybe when they were done with this feth-hole, the first would get rotated back to regimental reserve for a few months. six, maybe. a year. feygor had seen other companies get the call back out. the fething vitrians, for instance. they'd gone back into crusade reserve about eighteen months earlier and as far as feygor knew they were still there, sitting with their fething glass boots up on a table, smoking someone else's lhos, playing at garrison. the bluebloods too, those bastards had been pulled to the rear after vervunhive. there was no fething justice. feygor reached the next crest, a slope of loose rocks and ferns that bounded a deep dell where a thin stream splashed down its course under the dark trees. the trees, mountain ash, link-alder and some kind of spruce, creaked and moved their heads gently. a slight rise in the wind. westerly. the scent of rain. on one of the rocks lay a leaf, fresh, curled into a loop with the stalk stabbed through the blade of the leaf. feygor picked it up. one of ven's waymarkers. all the scouts left marks like this to show the squad behind them they'd cleared and passed ahead. you wouldn't notice them unless you knew to look. ven and jajjo would be half a kilometre ahead of them by now. as the detail made their way up the fern trail behind him, feygor pushed on, clambering up the tumble of rocks on the crest into a break in the trees where the sunlight could fall on him. the sky was tinged yellow, what he could see of it. clouds chased, gathering. rain definitely. maybe even a summer storm. feygor knew the signs. like brostin � and like his mentor rawne � feygor was a city boy. but even if you grew up in a place like tanith attica, you were never far from forest. feygor had got to know woodcraft and how to read the weather as a teenager, making the early morning runs out of attica's mercantile district into the african woods. you'd needed the skills in his trade. skills to find a particular clearing at a particular time, skills to get home the long way round without getting lost. skills to avoid the arbites and the excise men. feygor sat down and waited as the members of the detail came up over the crest. cuu, then caff, then gutes and rerval. brostin came back in the line, so that the betraying smell of his flamer's fuel tanks would be minimised. muril next quiet as a feline. feygor watched her move by, his gaze lingering once she'd gone past and afforded him a rear view. larkin was right in the tail. according to brostin, larkin had specifically requested this detail, which seemed odd to feygor. everyone knew that larkin and cuu were not exactly best buddies. larks usually did his level best to find occupation as far away from lijah cuu as possible. indeed, cuu had seemed puzzled by larkin's inclusion. puzzled. almost annoyed. but larkin seemed strangely relaxed. that was good, in murtan feygor's book. the last kind of crap he needed out here was larks in one of his manic phases. he'd keep an eye on the sniper. he'd asked piet gutes to do the same. feygor got up and slithered back down the crest to join larkin as he made the top. muril! larks is on dinner duty. buddy him up. the order clearly pleased her. half an hour poaching with larkin wasn't scout training with ven, but it was better than nothing. feygor knew she was itching to show her ability. anything to get in her good books. the pair of them began to descend the slope the way they'd come. feygor moved ahead, catching up with the rest of the detail. brostin had stopped to take a swig from his billy. right at the front, coming up the next rise in the shadow of the trees, cuu had paused too. he was staring back down the dell at the departing figure of larkin. larkin knelt and checked the spoor. it was fresh. some small animal, probably a grazer. muril asked. miss it? but i want to be a scout. i really want to make that grade. and that means packing in my beloved long-las for a standard mark iii. besides, i get the hat as compensation. he got up and practised sighting his long-las into the trees. he shrugged. but jajjo's getting all the attention. who did ven call up just now? me? i don't think so. did i do something wrong? or am i fooling myself? but really� muril asked. larkin had stopped breathing. the long-las felt weightless. the target-fix rune was flashing steady now. his right index finger slowly tightened on the trigger. lijah cuu stopped and turned to speak to gutes. the horizontal of larkin's cross hairs made a bar across cuu's eyes. the vertical almost followed the line of the trademark scar. right there. right now. kill-shot. larkin lowered the gun, breathed out and snapped the safety. heqta jajjo couldn't get the gakking leaf to bend. ven hunkered down and plucked a fresh leaf from a nearby clump of beythorn. mkvenner made a perfect loop and set it on a crop of white stone. jajjo sighed. they both knew he meant verghastites. jajjo picked up his mark iii, and advanced, head low they'd reached a long, curved valley of pine wood with a steeply tilted rake that was thick with last year's needles. the wind was up now, and the trees swayed and shushed over him. the air was cold. the sunlight had died off and plunged the forest floor into twilight. jajjo tried to make as little sound as possible. his foot cracked a piece of dead bark, and he looked back guiltily towards the place where he'd left mkvenner. the scout had gone. how the gak did he do that? jajjo worked the cover all the way down to a thick copse of link-alder. halfway down, he knocked his rifle-stock against a sapling. then he realised he hadn't draped himself with his camo-cape properly. gak on a flakboard, was there anything else he could get wrong? the sound of the wind in the trees was mesmeric now. like a sea, jajjo thought. his family had come from imjahive originally, down in the archipelago, one of verghast's tropical cities. he knew what the sea sounded like. he'd missed it when his family had moved to vervunhive, the year he turned six. jajjo stole past the copse, and crossed a spread of swishing ferns. the first spots of rain started to come down, smacking hard impacts into the leaves of the ground cover. jajjo tried to stick to the shadows. through the stand of pines ahead, there seemed to be something, he couldn't tell what. he switched cover, making short runs between trees, the way he'd been taught in scout preparation. now the sounds he made were being masked by the gathering rainstorm and wind. he kept his mark iii tucked up under his right armpit barrel down, so it wouldn't catch on anything. the rain got heavier. the drops beat down like a non-stop drum roll on the leaves. the temperature immediately rose by a few degrees, lifting skeins of mist from the ground and choking his nose with a damp, mulchy reek. jajjo reached the pine stand, and slid through the trees. what the hell was that up there? there was definitely some sort of clearing. a break in the trees. he could tell that simply from the light. he got down in the ferns and crawled for the last twenty metres to the edge of the clearing, pushing his weapon in front of him. he stammered. he turned to rise and work back, but mkvenner was crouched right behind him. ven and jajjo back-tracked to meet the detail, and led them forward. it was a house. a big house. a retreat. rerval described it as a manse, and the name stuck. derelict and overgrown, it occupied a cleared stretch of hillside within the forest, facing west. lime-washed grey stone, black slate. two storeys and maybe an attic. blind windows looked out across an unkempt garden from the front. there was a weed-choked path leading to the front porch, and the signs of an old wall and gate in the overgrown hedges. gutes and caffran circled round the rear and found a single-storey wing extending from the back, and a clutch of outbuildings clogged against the back garden wall around a paved yard. beyond that, a wild garden and lawn stretched up hill to the edge of the pine woods. there was an old wall at the top of the lawn, against which sat several more dilapidated outhouses. the rain was torrential now. they split. feygor, gutes, cuu and brostin to the front door; caffran, rerval, jajjo and mkvenner to the back. the dripping ghosts with him nodded. gutes and cuu dropped in either side of the big, old doors. paint was flaking off the panels. squeaked feygor and shot it. he hit it in the belly and there was a loud burst of fur and dust. feygor shouted over gutes' fire. the monster continued to snarl at them. the micro-bead link went wild. jajjo. ven. feygor was laughing, his giggles rolling flat and dry from his voice box. said brostin. feygor walked over to the stuffed trophy. it was quite a beast. cuu smiled. caffran had led his team into the back kitchen. ven asked. aiming his lamp beam into the shadows, caffran edged through the scullery and an empty, damp-smelling washroom. jajjo followed him. jajjo found a door off the kitchen that came free with a lack. it was a walk-in pantry, the shelves lined with fruit pickles and jars of preserved vegetables. four haunches of salted meat hung from the beam hooks. they'd been on lousy rations since landfall. caffran's team found feygor's in the cellar of the house. a short ran of stone steps let down into it via a door in the hall. labelled by vintage, the wine racks were arranged in five rows of shelves. go light the fire. stoke it up, mind. they could all hear the wind and rain beating down outside. �count golke, on the seiberq pocket in silence, they waited until the guns had stopped. then they went out. up over scaling ladders, up over the parapet. into the blackness and the mud. into little, individual worlds of suffocating gas-hoods. it was just before 03.30 in the morning, and day seemed a whole lifetime away. her platoon was straggled out. somewhere to their left was five platoon, soric's band. somewhere to her right was seventeen, raglon's. somewhere around her was her own gakking platoon, not that she could see them. the damn hoods: blindfolds, gags, earmuffs all rolled into one. there was a kind of light. it twinkled through the imperfect plastic lenses of her hood. amber, dull. just enough to pick out the landscape of no-man's land. smoggy vapour fumed from the craters. it hid the wires. pools of chemical water in deep shell holes gave off a leery phosphorescent glow. this was a game. not a fun one. nobody had been looking forward to it. not since they'd been transferred to 58th sector.  criid missed having dafelbe with her. word was he was recovering from the face wound. she'd had to move mkhef up as her adjutant, and she didn't get on with the lanky tanith as well. the ground was wet and sticky. it was like striding through caramel. she turned her head. it was mkhef, waiting while kenfeld and vulli came up with the cutters. criid crouched down. all around her, anonymous, hooded ghosts were slipping in, just shadows in the bad light. everyone was cloaked up, shrouded in their camouflage capes. kenfeld reported, his voice sounding like it came from a box. barely fifty metres to criid's left soric guided his platoon ahead. despite the proximity, he couldn't see any of criid's bunch, or obel's, which was allegedly running to his left flank. agun soric was sweating inside his hood. he hated hood work. he was blind and stifled, his already reduced vision cut down to a pathetic scrap. the mud was hell. wet-soft and deep. it sucked at boots, pulled feet down at every stride, like the earth was hungry. soric barked, panting in the humid darkness of his hood. soric stood back, trying to let his lungs fill. all he could taste was damp, hot air. perspiration was running into his one good eye. hefron got back up and soric sent him on his way with a cuff to the back of the head. he'd gone a pace or two himself when he tripped on something hard buried in the muck and went down. liquid mud drowned his hood's visor. he couldn't see. he could taste filthy water pouring in through the gauze filter. there was a squeak and vision returned. vivvo was scooping the mud from soric's hood-lenses with his fingers. step on. soric trudged forward, feeling his leg for the braise. something had smacked into it hard when he fell. there was something in his pocket. blindly, he took it out and held it up. it was the brass message shell. soric's heart began to race even harder. he was sure he'd left that fething thing in his dugout. fumbling with muddy, gloved fists, he unscrewed the cap. there was the folded sheet of blue tissue paper he'd been expecting. it was hard to read through the smeared hood visor. it said. signals! signals! soric clicked off the mic and sat back for a moment, gazing up. the sky was dark, fumed with a haze of yellow. there were no stars. asked mohr. he was getting anxious. the platoon was leaving them behind. that line under the first. his wet fingers had blurred the ink. it was just a smudge. he peered at it what the gak did it say? he ought to know. he'd gakking written it. or something with handwriting just like his had, anyway. something, soric knew, even if it scared the living gak out of him, he had to trust. something something don't let something� what was that? was it? shit , what had this said? the first part had been a warning to tona. was raglon going to get into a mess too? god-emperor, what did it say? he said. mohr asked nervously. i said that out loud, thought soric. the mud and darkness closed in on all sides. there was no sign of vivvo or the rest of five platoon. soric grabbed mohr by the arm and started to trudge forward. there was no landscape out here to read in any proper sense. just burst earth and wreckage. for all criid knew, they could be heading back to their own lines. but somehow hwlan saw the way. the tanith scout had the lead, nudging the extended line of ten platoon across the wasteland. at least they had the relief of losing the hoods. how'd soric known it was clear? a message from the atmossniffers at the line, criid presumed. the darkness seemed solid, vicing them in. the odour of death and soiled water was almost suffocating. criid ducked into a shallow crater with nessa and vril, and they found themselves swimming alongside bloated, swollen corpses. criid whispered. nessa crawled up the forward edge of the crater and scoped with her long-las. the link chimed. she was. she was fine. she was sergeant tona criid, tanith first-and-fething-only, the only fern who'd ever made that grade. she wasn't going to gak it up now. it didn't matter what she felt about caff, or yoncy or dalin. she'd chosen to be a soldier, and worked to get the pins. love was just an anchor she didn't need. the others did the same. vril asked. angry, suth took hold of costin by the jaw and gave him a sharp slap on the cheek. be quiet! he mouthed, urgently. glowering, costin sat back. suth turned, and began to edge forward along the watery swill of the trench pit, then levered himself out of the trench on his belly and started to crawl. costin stared after suth for a moment, his pride wounded. he wiped his hand across his mouth, and then spat the slime he'd inadvertently deposited there. it tasted foul. he leaned up to see how far suth had got, but the scout was out of sight. costin sniffed, and then took a flask bottle out of his fatigue pocket. he took a swig, but it was virtually empty and he tasted only fumes. so he tipped it back. tipped it right back to get at the dregs. the glass bottle flashed as the background light caught it. costin wailed as a rifle round exploded his hand and the bottle it was holding. a second later, and another shot tore open his tunic across the right shoulder. costin began to whimper as he fell into the bottom of the trench. azayda leapt forward, desperate to quieten costin, and a third round burst the verghastite's head like a ripe fruit. back down the line, raglon heard the cries and the sudden shots, and cursed aloud. he tried to push forward, but his men were being driven back by furious sniper fire and quick bursts of semi-automatic shooting. zemel dropped, killed outright. tyne took a hit in the knee and another through the arm. lukas lurched over with a yell as a shot smashed his vox-caster. suth was down, alone, out in the open. he could see the glitter of shots cutting up the trench towards his platoon. he could see the shapes of the raiders as they hurried forward. he felt the worst possible feeling a tanith scout can ever feel: that he had led his comrades into danger. he didn't hesitate. he got up, and ran the trench from the side, his lasgun blazing, assaulting the stormers from the flank. he made several kills before their massed firepower cut him down. to the north, soric's platoon froze and dropped as they heard the gunfire start up. and though he hated to admit it, he knew for certain who that poor bastard was. raglon. the abrupt gunfire just a half kilometre south startled criid and made her lower her aim for an instant. she'd been about to take the gakking shot. she saw the spotter on the second floor of the mill get up and hurry over to the other side of the building, stepping expertly over gaps in the planks. she heard voices in the rear room of the obs post. do i wait or do i go for it , she asked herself? she took aim again. her shot punched through a floorboard from below and severed the right shin of the spotter. he screamed out, fell, and came crashing through the rotten planks, bouncing off a jut of girder-post on his way down. vril, mkhef and hwlan ploughed in, killing the others below with quick, merciless shots. criid ran in to join them, ordering the rest of her group to hold position. the sounds of a serious firefight was rolling in from the south. vril and hwlan stood cover as criid and mkhef searched the obs post area. cooking pots, boxes of ammo for a .45 cannon set up in a broken window, cans of processed meat, a field telephone. a strange, ugly statuette made of painted clay that criid smashed against the wall the moment she saw it. five, ten and eleven came back in. daur shook his head. she's annoyed. daur nodded. gaunt put the porcelain cup down on the table carefully because he was aware he'd been about to throw it. he'd sent four platoons out on this first night to play the alliance's new game, and he'd only got three back. raglon. he'd been gaunt's vox-officer for several years. he'd been so proud to get his pins and his command. gaunt managed a thin smile. zweil frowned. zweil grinned. gaunt had always liked that grin, from the moment he'd first met the old priest on hagia. cried gaunt. best of three? zweil nodded. gaunt had called criid to his dugout. he wanted to know more about this mill she'd found. but when the knock came, it wasn't criid. it was count golke. he was wearing battledress. before i got drawn into the political nonsense running this war. i think i've outlived my usefulness as a staff officer. let me be a soldier again. � trooper brostin the storm that had begun the previous evening showed no sign of easing up. rain drummed the roof of the manse and pattered against the windows all night. past midnight, peals of thunder and brilliant flashes of lightning had made it seem like they were still back at the line, enduring shelling. by dawn, the electrical tumult had stopped, but the rain had got harder it was as if the vast, black thunderheads were too heavy to clear the peaks of the massif and had hooked there, deluging the forest like dirigibles trying to shed ballast. from the streaming porch windows of the manse, caffran could see out onto the gloomy garden at the front. already overgrown by the time they'd pitched up the night before, it was now littered with torn leaves and broken boughs brought down in the night. swirling rivers of rainwater gushed from the higher slopes of the rear gardens, via a hedged ditch on the east side of the manse, to the gate. a lower part of the lawn was actually underwater. he went back down the hall to the kitchen. it was early still. from the drawing room, he could hear loud, bellicose snoring. no point disturbing those sleepers, he decided. various pots and pans from the kitchen shelves stood on the floor of the hall and up some of the stairs, pinging and beating as they caught steady drips coming in from above. caffran nudged one around with his foot, so it was more completely under a particularly busy trickle. mkvenner, jajjo and muril were in the kitchen. ven was sitting at the table, studying the map and chewing on a cbar ration. muril was occupying the window bench, sipping a can of caffeine. jajjo greeted caffran and offered him a cup from the pot on the stove. he was munching on some leftovers from the previous night's meal. muril and larkin had caught up with them about an hour after they'd entered the manse. soaked through, they were carrying a knife-trimmed branch from which hung a plump buck. nineteen detail had eaten well. some of them had drunk well too. said caffran. yeah, all three of us did. but brostin and cuu were meant to do the small hours, and they didn't bother. the idea alarmed him. he couldn't remember the last time he'd spent a night in the field without someone on perimeter. anyone could have snuck up in the dark. the whole fething shadik republic could have snuck up in the dark. like they were off duty. jajjo sniffed. neither one of them had disgraced themselves the night before either, though rerval had become a little tipsy. larkin had disappeared early. the intended rebuke had annoyed him. caffran wondered where. the heavy drinkers had spent the night in the drawing room by the fire. caffran sighed. the pair of them left the kitchen and walked back down the hall towards the dining room. the hall was dark, and they easily saw the little flash that briefly lit the windows. a short delay, and thunder growled distantly. jajjo paused in the doorway of the dining room. he was staring at something. that raincoat. don't start. cried feygor and kicked out at the stuffed beast. he glanced at jajjo before the dark-skinned trooper could speak. feth you! old habits die hard. brostin turned over in his bedroll, and put his hands behind his head. the pose emphasised the huge girth of his arms and pecs. he stared at caffran. i wish i'd thought of that. i really do. it's neat, it's sneaky. it serves my purpose. but i was planning on staying here a while anyway, vox-link or no vox-link. i didn't feth with your beloved caster. snapped feygor. everyone looked on, stony-faced. caffran didn't like what he was seeing. feygor yawned. brostin got up and shambled out. okay? nothing. perimeter's secure. the area's quiet. though someone or something's disturbed one of the outhouses. okay. brostin came back in, his arms full of wine bottles. caffran called out as he ran through the rain, up the back plot of the manse, after the retreating scout. mkvenner stopped and waited for him. thunder clashed above them. yeah, mkvenner nodded. caffran shrugged. thunder rolled again. in an ideal galaxy, we'd all go. the way we were meant to. but thanks to murtan feygor, this isn't an ideal galaxy. so we improvise. that's what we're good at, after all. if i find something out there, emperor protect me, i'd like to have a patrol fire-team at my back. failing that, i'd like to know there's a secure, well-defended strongpoint position not too far away at my heels. stay here, caff. right here. get muril, rerval, larkin �maybe even gutes, like you said � and lock this place up ready. just in case. caffran nodded. mkvenner took his hand and gripped it tight. okay. send jajjo up. caffran stood and watched mkvenner stride away through the rain until he had vanished into the edge of the wood. thunder boomed. oh, that's just typical! there was a particularly loud roar from the drawing room. a crash. laughter. okay? why the gak does jajjo get to scout? haven't you had enough? gutes replied. gutes slurred. gutes looked sad. he pulled the door shut, cutting out the sounds of merrymaking. he leaned against the hall wall and slid down until he was sitting. gutes struggled up to his feet. stand three platoons to if command requests us, we'll move at once. whistles were blowing all along the trench system to sound all-clear. the gas had washed out of the line. gaunt took off his respirator and wiped his sweat-damp face. he produced a data-slate. muttered rawne. he looked across the aisle at her cot with a withering stare, but she just grinned. she was pale, and a cut above her right eye was black with stitches. her mending lungs were having a hard time coping with the wretched air. still, she found the breath to taunt him. rawne got up off his cot, and sat carefully. the ward hall was full of ghosts, as well as a few krassians, casualties from that first trench fight at the 55th sector. many, like rawne, were healing well, but it would be a long time before they could be pronounced fit for active duty. rawne wondered how many more ghosts would come through these halls before the present occupants made their way out. the days since he had been wounded had passed at a dishearteningly slow crawl. rawne felt detached and very much out of the loop, even though he'd been brought regular reports. he wanted to get up and out, but not because he was such a dutiful soldier he needed to get back to play his part. he was distressed at the prospect of what feth-heads like daur might be doing in his absence. he didn't reply. he grabbed hold of the back of a wooden chair and slowly dragged himself to his feet. the pain in his stomach, which had been a dormant ache for the last thirty hours, started to throb again. he took a deep breath, and let go of the chair back. god-emperor, it was hard. it felt like his legs had atrophied. it felt like someone had upturned a live brazier in his belly. it felt like someone was stabbing a bayonet into his spine. banda repeated for the third time. that did it. rawne hadn't been addressed by rank for what seemed like an age. especially by jessi banda. if he but admitted it, that had been the best part of this enforced stay in the ward. jammed together by the proximity of their beds, the comatose nature of their immediate neighbours, and their shared suffering at station 293, they had provided conversational company for one another. it wasn't a friendship, exactly rawne certainly wouldn't acknowledge anything like that, but they'd talked, and played boredom-defeating word games, and joked occasionally. after the first few hours of them being cooped up together involuntarily, she had stopped calling him major and he'd stopped calling her trooper. they had formed a cordial, sparring companionship as a reaction to their situation. oh, what? and leave me here? and i thought we were mates. she said. gakking well help, then. okay? wounded, bedridden. he told me the thing he missed worst, what hurt him worst, was missing stuff. the physical pain of injuries didn't matter so much. it was losing his place in things. why did you order me not to die? just go. called curth. pulling his cape around his shoulders, dorden hurried up the entrance ramp of the infirmary behind beltayn. dorden yelled at rawne in frustration, then followed beltayn up the trench. rawne sat back down and produced a hip-flask from his pocket he unscrewed the cap and offered it to banda. hwlan had found the mill the night before, and they were trusting his instincts to lead them in. to hwlan, an experienced scout with many years as a tracker in the nalwoods of tanith in his past it was a strange experience. many said the tanith could never get lost, and claimed they had the most unerring sense of direction. the constantly shifting trees of tanith had bred that into them. that was the theory, anyway. the chemical attack had changed the ground, baking the mud so dry it had begun to crack. underneath it was wet and soft, and the feet of the troopers cracked the surface as they advanced, spilling up mud as fluid and yellow as custard. vague landmarks from the previous night � a broken tree, a fence of wire, a dead tank � had solidified and become permanent but they'd also been changed by the action of gas. the pocket had become a dead space of embalmed features, desiccated, fused, chemically transmuted. the point men reached a wire barricade that collapsed into rust as they touched it. the liquid chemicals accreted in some crater holes were burning. and there were so many corpses. dorden was shocked.  fresh corpses, hooked in wire or lying on the ground, so florid they looked like they were still alive. others, older, hunched and flattened into the postures of submission only dead men can afford. others, older still, cadaverous and dry, opening their bones to the sky. it was also grimly silent. there was no wind, and the gas clouds stifled all noise. a bright, dry desert of war, lethal to the touch and the merest breath. gaunt placed milo and nehn from domor's platoon with zweil. the old ayatani was a newcomer to gas gear and was clearly uncomfortable with the mask and the thick gloves. he'd cinched up the skirts of his long coat so that they wouldn't drag in the mire, revealing an incongruous, borrowed pair of heavy aexegarian army boots. gaunt could hear a mumbling over the vox. zweil was quietly reciting a prayer of protection. they saw the occasional rusting scrap of a respirator valve, a saddle buckle, the bent barrel of a carbine. on the far side of the ridge, the ground shelved away into a wide basin where a brackish crescent of water shone in the flat light. old piquets marched in a line down the slope and disappeared into the pool. along the eastern shore of the water, the mud was crinkled into strange patches that reminded gaunt of rose blooms. shards of ashy glass clung to the folds of each patch. he realised they were the impact marks of gas bottles from a previous attack. the mud had baked and puckered with the intensity of the leaking toxins. an alliance trooper stood on the far side of the pool, headless. his rotting body was held up by the metal stake he'd fallen against. the trio of scouts led them round the side of the basin, and out over its lowest lip. they entered a flat area covered in shell craters some large enough to swallow a man, others just pock-marks the size of a fist. the craters overlapped each other, small inside large, large intersecting with larger. the pattern was so dense and seemed so deliberate, it was surreal. to their north, on a bank of mud, lay the burnt-black carcass of a shadik tank. mkoll indicated they should turn south a little, but golke consulted his chart and advised against it a row of crossed timbers suggested to him the edge of a mined area. old munitions, but it was stupid to risk it, and they weren't set for sweeping work. in order to move light, landmine experts like domor had left their sweeper sets at the line. they moved north-east instead, following a mangled ridge, plodding through murky strands of water and oil. to their left was a series of waterlogged pits absolutely choked with bodies, as if the dead had all decided to congregate in one place. zweil realised he was glad of his mask. since they'd set out, they'd been able to hear the roaring of the counter-assault pushing ahead of them, a little to the south. now they heard a deeper, more booming noise. gaunt asked mkoll without much hope. mkoll gestured at the hood he was wearing. but it's vague. we're approaching from a slightly different angle to last night. clear. we're at the outside wall. two big rockcrete beams fallen in a v-shape. gaunt acknowledged. golke tried to see the beams. the squad came up, and gaunt advanced with them. six men: domor, luhan, vril and harjeon, with dremmond and lubba and their flamers. gaunt left fire command with criid. they reached mkoll's position. the scouts were ready to go in. gaunt yelled, just before his men started to return fire and hose the south face of the mill. the shots had been las-rounds. a pause. faint static on the link. it was raglon. eleven she wouldn't even take off her raincoat she allowed larkin and caffran to lead her into the gloomy kitchen and sit her at one of the chairs by the table. she flinched as rerval suddenly came in from outside. he looked at the old woman in confusion. rerval said suddenly. he asked.  the sudden voice made her flinch again. smash it, maybe. lift the primary transmission circuit? caffran looked at the frail old woman. she was still immobile, placid. her hair was silver, almost white, pinned back rightly with small metal clips. her clothes were clean, but old and faded, and her little leather buckle-on shoes were worn. he could see the sole was coming away from one of them. the only reaction she made, every once in a while, was to wince and look round at any loud noise emanating from the drawing room. the crash of a glass breaking. a thump. brostin's booming laugh. we're invaders, he thought, invaders in her home. in the rain? and if she's been hiding, why hang her coat up larkin frowned. rerval asked. stay with her, larks. i'll go tell muril about her and advise her to keep her eyes peeled for any other houseguests. cuu said. his eyes were hooded and he swayed slightly. cuu drunkenly flapped a hand at larkin, his attention on the old woman. he leaned down, putting his leering face close to hers. shut up, tanith. come on, you old witch! cuu reached out and grabbed her roughly by one thin shoulder. she let out a little gasp of fear. larkin leaned forward and grasped cuu tightly by the wrist. he yanked cuu's arm back, tearing his grip from the old woman's shoulder, and slowly rose to his feet, pushing the drunken verghastite backwards. he fell back unsteadily, drink slowing his reactions, but quickly locked and pushed back. there was a dull thump, like a muffled peal of thunder, and he blacked out. he came to, sprawled face down across the table. the back of his head hurt really badly. his vision swam. he tried to rise, but lost his balance and fell off the side of the table onto the floor. the fall saved him. cuu brought the iron skillet pan down for a second blow and hit the table where larkin had just been crumpled. the pan exploded the cup and sprayed porcelain shards and tepid caffeine across the polished wood. larkin tried to crawl backwards away from cuu, but the verghastite came for him, swinging the pan again. it caught larkin on the shoulder. he kicked out at cuu's legs. cuu reached down and grabbed larkin by the throat. with a snarl that flecked spittle out between his clenched teeth, cuu hauled larkin up and threw him against the side counter. he pinned larkin with the flat of his forearm, and hit him with the pan again. larkin squealed as he felt a rib go. another savage blow and pain flared through his left elbow. but for that raised arm, the heavy pan would have mashed his face. cuu rained down slurs and blows alike in a berserk fury. suddenly, cuu shrieked and collapsed off larkin, dropping the pan with a clang. the metal frame stock of a mark iii las-rifle had just smashed up between his legs from behind. cuu hit the floor, convulsing and choking, tears washing down his screwed up face. he fell in a foetal position, clutched at his groin and threw up. the old woman made a sudden dash for the open door, but caffran intercepted her gently and sat her back down. she didn't protest. muril helped larkin up. he was shaking. one cheek was swelling and turning blue, and blood streamed from his nose the back of his head had left more blood on the countertop. if we hadn't come back� his head swaying back and forth like his neck was rubber, feygor frowned and made several vague pointing gestures around the room. cuu was hurting the old lady? feygor said, clapping his hands. feygor said. feygor spluttered. good question, caffran thought. brostin tugged at feygor's arm. he wheeled around, unsteadily, and wandered into the pantry. they could hear the smash of breaking jars as he foraged for food. brostin stood for a moment, and then followed feygor out. he looked over at muril, who shook her head. caffran bent down and hauled cuu towards the door. gutes? war's our life, you know that. first-and-only. tired. tired of it all. gutes drummed his fingers on the table top and then took a swig of the wine. he offered the bottle to rerval, and rerval knocked back a sip himself. my daughter. my wife died eighteen� no, nineteen years back.  i raised finra on my own, you know? did a good job, i think. she was a beautiful girl. and foona. a little darling, my first grandchild. the candle flame fluttered and almost went out. then it flared again, as wax dribbled from the lip. thunder slammed above the percussion of rain outside. my daughter, i mean. the one that comes in the vellum envelope. the one that says except i didn't get any letter. a pre-dawn glow was spreading in through the kitchen windows. the old woman was asleep, curled up on the bench seat. larkin was sitting hunched at the table, nursing a glass of sacra. the bruises on his face were almost black, and muril was worried about the wound on the back of his head. everyone else was long since asleep, except caffran and rerval, who were standing guard. muril got up and used a cloth to open the stove plate. she sat down opposite larkin. larks! muril blanched. so that's why you want� everyone knows that. she leaned forward towards him. forget this whole conversation. stark dawn light spread across the back lawns of the manse. mist wisped up from the wet grass. he caught the movement out of the corner of his eye. not much, just a flicker of something.  the vaguest flicker. caffran left his sentry post in the greenhouse and ran up the main back lawn. daybreak birdsong rang around him. say again? say again? comeuppance. �refrain of popular aexegarian song nine men dead. six injured. three more sick with gas-related injuries caused by tears in their kit. seventeen platoon was a mess. and raglon knew it. gaunt could tell the novice sergeant was badly shaken and terribly ashamed of himself. his first field office, and he'd ended up with less then fifty per cent of his platoon alive or able-bodied. gaunt's infiltration force moved up to occupy the ghastly ruins of the santrebar mill, and as the four platoons took station at windows and likely firepoints, dorden co-opted half a dozen of them to help him deal with raglon's wounded. two were close to death. sicre and mkwyl; there was no hope for them. dorden called for zweil. it was getting on for 19.00 hours, and the day was beginning to fade. the dull bluster of the counter-push still rolled across the wasteland towards them from the south, and the deep booming of the super-siege guns continued. everything was still closed in and swaddled by the yellow gas vapour. just after the hour, it began to rain. the light changed, a soft blush across the low yellow sky. it reminded golke of the way a brush wash could alter a watercolour. painting had been his hobby, years before. he stood, looking out from one of the mill's low windows, almost admiring the view. it was stark and unlovely, but there was a quality to it. the dark, rusty ground, the off-white sky slowly saturating with blue-grey. weighed down with his battlefield mail, heavy coat and respirator, he felt distanced. this was the land he was fighting for, the land he had spent his adult life fighting for. as far as his eyes could see, there was nothing but the scarring of warfare. this wasn't the site of a battle, this was landscape transformed by the brute sorcery of relentless fighting. stripped, burned, poisoned, malformed, killed. he wondered why, then, he admired its eerie beauty. surely it wasn't just the amateur painter in him making a trite aesthetic response. this was the pocket, he told himself. the seiberq pocket. that murderous slab of country that had robbed him of his friends, his men and his health. he'd emerged from this place a wreck, so dismayed by its horrors that he'd been receiving counselling from his physician ever since. the memories still lacerated his mind. he tried to picture it living again. ten, fifty years in the future, a hundred� whatever it might take. he tried to imagine the war over, and peace slowly restoring the rule of nature. trees. fields. life of any kind. golke could imagine it, but the vision was not convincing. this, the ravaged vista before him, was the only truth. he knew why it was important to him. the pocket had haunted him for years, lurking in his nightmares and daydreams. and now he'd come back to face it. that's really why he had volunteered to assist gaunt's mission. this was aversion therapy. he'd come back to face his daemons and deny them, exorcise them, banish them. he'd come back to recover something lost by his younger self. the pocket was a hellhole, an unfeasibly ugly ruin. but already he could see some beauty in it. he'd taken the first step. he'd looked upon the landscape of his nightmares and hadn't frozen in terror. he could do this. he could break the pocket just like it had once broken him. two months earlier, his aides had dragged him out for a night at the musical hall in ongche. a popular touring show was in town, and they'd insisted he'd enjoy it. the gaudily-painted theatre had been packed with rowdy soldiers on furlough, but golke had enjoyed the performance from one of the balcony-boxes. it had all been amusing enough, though the common troopers loved it as if it was the best thing ever. a conjuror, an acrobat troupe, a virtuoso viol player, a clown act with trained canines, singers, bandsmen, a rather feeble soprano. a famous comedian in a too-small hat who strutted the stage and made off-colour remarks about shadik sexuality and hygiene to furious approval. then had come the girl, the little girl from fichua, the top of the bill. this, his senior aide told him excitedly, was what the boys were all waiting for. she didn't seem much, just a child in a hoop skirt and bodice. but her voice� she sang three songs. they were funny and saucy and patriotic. the last was a ditty golke had heard the men singing from time to time. an ironic piece about doing your bit in which the soldier assured his superiors he was willing to fight, but expressed the wish to do so somewhere safe. three curtain calls and goodnight. it was in his head now. the refrain went round and round. anywhere but here. he understood why the men, sentimental fools the lot of them, like all soldiers off-duty, loved it so. it was catchy and bright and funny. it voiced their secret desires. it let them laugh away their dearest and most hidden wishes. the tune died away in his head. staring out at the misery of the pocket, it simply faded away. golke could see through its reassuring lie. this was where he wanted to be. this was where he needed to be. not anywhere but here. right here. and right now. the rain fell harder, sizzling on the poisoned ground, gushing through the crippled drainage of the mill. it was so intense that within fifteen minutes the air had cleared and the sky had become greyer and bigger. dorden used his atmosphere sniffer and declared that the gas-level had dropped under advised limits. gratefully, the troopers began to unbuckle their hoods. the open air was cold and damp, and retained the metallic scent of the gas, muddled with rot and soaked earth. some of the men were so relieved to be out of their hoods, they started laughing and chatting. gaunt got beltayn to circuit the mill and relay orders for them to hold it down. zweil, his head bared again, said a blessing to the sky, and then went back to sicre and mkwyl. both were dead, and he'd said last rites over both of them already. it was getting darker. apart from drifting streams of artillery smoke, they could see for several kilometres. the sky was turning black, and the lights of the lines, both friend and foe, were visible.  over in the east, the false dawn of a flare barrage lit the landscape white. from the south came the flashes and glows of the counter-push. beyond the eastern horizon, the great blinks of light from the super-siege guns backlit the land. overhead, in the dark, muddy blue, gaunt could see stars, for the first time since he'd set foot on aexe cardinal. they were twinkling and blurred by the thinning smoke in the upper atmosphere, but he could make them out. every now and then, a red or orange line scored the sky as rockets flew over. part of the peinforq line � sector 56, gaunt guessed � began to strobe as it started off the night's barrage. they could hear the whine and squeal of shells in flight. fires began to burn along the reciprocal edge of the shadik lines. mortars pounded from somewhere. feldkannone crumped. another night on the front began. he led raglon to a quieter corner of the mill ruin and sat him down. raglon was strung out and shaking. gaunt nodded. raglon nodded, but he still seemed unsettled. he gave away our position by failing to observe proper stealth discipline. raglon moaned. gaunt walked through the mill. gaunt reached the dingy alcove of rockcrete where costin was lying. dorden was changing the dressings of the trooper's shattered hand. the doctor looked up, and recognised the grim set of gaunt's face. no. no way, gaunt. not now. go on. i'm defying your orders. if costin deserves the bullet for breaking your orders, so do i. so, shoot me. or have everyone know you as an inconsistent leader � one rule for one, another for another. gaunt's finger tightened on the trigger. tighter. tighter. good advice, gaunt mused to himself as he rejoined mkoll. deeds not words. time was getting on and they were in danger of losing the lead they'd gained earlier. either they moved on the shadik lines now, or packed it in. gaunt called golke, beltayn and the platoon leaders to join them. gaunt said, inviting opinions. gaunt asked. she walked them to the back of the mill and showed them the pile of blast-collapsed rabble that marked the tunnel mouth. mkoll shook his head. arcuda nodded and hurried off. golke nodded, impressed. milo looked crestfallen. inexperienced, milo wanted to say. gaunt sighed and nodded. milo had turned out to be a first class soldier, with a real promise of leadership qualities, despite his age. either of the suggestions � arcuda, green and nervous, and raglon, shaken and tired � would make more sense. indeed, gaunt knew he'd rather have milo in his fire-team than either of the sergeants. there was another reason for his choice, one that had been nagging at him for days. he wanted to tell milo about the old sororitas woman in the forgotten woodland chapel, but every time he turned it over in his mind, it sounded stupid. he didn't really even believe it himself. she'd said milo was important. not here, important elsewhere. then again, she'd been barking mad. if, he acknowledged to himself, she'd even been there at all. that whole incident had taken on a very dreamlike quality in his head. but ibram gaunt had been alive long enough to know that the galaxy moved in ways far stranger than he could ever divine. his whole life had been bisected and intercut with mysterious truths and consequences. coincidences. destinies. truths that didn't seem to be truths until years afterwards. he could not risk it. he could not risk milo. milo shrugged. he was quite taken aback by the prospect of a promotion and a command. at vervunhive, it had been a toss up between milo and baffels, and gaunt had given the command to baffels on the basis of age and experience. milo was so very young. but war had aged him since then. so had experience. gaunt knew that if he offered the rank to milo now, it wouldn't be turned down. he wasn't a boy anymore. that made sense. milo and nessa had formed a good bond during the ouranberg raid. gaunt smiled and saluted milo. milo returned the gesture. the infiltration team filed quickly into the dugout run mkoll and domor had the lead, followed by lubba and hwlan. gaunt was right behind them with bonin. initially, the earth-dug tunnel dropped away rather sharply the floor was a congealed mass of soil-waste. but after about ten metres, it levelled out and its nature changed. rather than earth-cut walls, the tunnel was made of mouldering stone, old, but well-laid. it reminded gaunt of a storm-drain or a sewer. it was far too elaborate and significant to have been built to cover republican troops out to the forward observation point at the mill. this was ancient. gaunt realised it was most likely some part of the mill's old watersystem, a drain or possibly a feeder sluice. the shadik had unearthed it and put it to use. it was quite narrow and low, and the wet, slime-covered stones were treacherous, especially in the near-pitch darkness. they dared not use lamp packs for fear of advertising their approach. domor adjusted his optics to night-vision mode. after a further twenty metres, the tunnel dropped again, this time suddenly, and they had to wade through kneedeep water. there was greater damage to the stone work � evidently this part of the tunnel had subsided or dropped badly. gaunt looked back down the file. his eyes had adjusted to the gloom, as much as they were going to, anyway. he could see grey-black shapes moving against the darkness, and hear the occasional splash or clink of rock. it was hard effort, and the men were trying to keep their breathing quiet. it was also hot and airless, and everyone was sweating freely. about three hundred metres along, mkoll called a stop. a secondary tunnel opened up to the left, also stone-built, and water gurgled out of it. they waited while the master scout checked it. a minute. two. three. then a double-tap on the micro-bead link. a side chute. dead-end. it's collapsed. gaunt said. wait. domor suddenly cried out. he could see further than any of them. he had his flamer ready. gaunt said. report! the sounds of the shelling grew louder, but not because they were closer. there was a faint, cold light ahead, and the noise of the barrage was being carried back along to them from the tunnel mouth. just a hundred metres to go. straight silver. up ahead, the three scouts emerged into the open air. it was cold and foggy from the shelling, and the shock-flashes of blasts backlit the misted air. the sound of the barrage was deafening: whooping shell-falls, some high-pitched, some low and basso, others still oddly melodic and expressive. most detonations were huge and so loud they shook the diaphragm. others made hotter, flatter sounds. some made no sound at all, just a flash and a quake of the ground. after every single one there was a surging, pattering hush, like breakers on a shingle beach, as soil and shrapnel rained down. finding their way by the strobing flicker of the impacts, mkoll, bonin and hwlan scurried out of the tunnel mouth, heads down. there was a sandbagged revetment and a guard point at the shadik end of the tunnel, but it was unmanned. the guards had fled for cover. the scouts found themselves in a deep bay off the main fire trench. they fanned out to the exit, and then ducked back as three shadik troopers ran past boots clumping the duck-boards. these disappeared, and then two more came by, carrying a screaming man on a stretcher they too vanished into the glowing smoke.  mkoll signalled the other two up with him. they emerged into the fire trench proper. it was deeper and better laid than the alliance trenches, with a wider firestep and a back-slanted parapet of rockcrete blocks. a moment later, five shadik troopers, running hell for leather, appeared round the traverse to their left. they didn't seem to register the tanith until the last moment. the scouts didn't give them a chance to react. mkoll brought down the first one, sliding his silver knife through gas-mask and windpipe. hwlan skewered another in the sternum and then propelled himself and the corpse into a third. bonin crashed his rifle-butt into the belly of the enemy soldier nearest him, and sent him tumbling away, winded, then put his weight into a stinging sidekick that snapped the fifth trooper's neck and dropped him abruptly onto the duck-boards. bonin leapt over him, and quickly killed the winded man with his bare hands. hwlan tried to make a clean kill of the last trooper, but the fether was struggling hard. the tanith man got his lasrifle braced across the man's neck and wrenched it around, twisting the helmeted skull down hard against the trench floor. five men dealt with in just a few seconds. gaunt asked. the party moved off quickly behind mkoll and hwlan. two scouts at the head and two at the rear was the best insurance gaunt could muster. beyond the second traverse they came to, a shadik fire-team was trying to set up a pair of autocannons at the parapet. nine men, all told. mkoll and hwlan came at them from behind, knives out gaunt followed them, drawing his power sword, along with criid, ezlan and lasalle. brutal killing followed. one of the shadik got a shot off, but gaunt hoped its sound would be drowned by the barrage. he decapitated a man with his sword, and then impaled another. nothing stopped his ancient blade, not mail-armour, not battle-plate, not leather and certainly not flesh. criid finished off the last man, and looked up at gaunt. the shelling had just suddenly ceased. that meant the ground attack was coming. and it also meant that the shadik would be streaming back out of their bunkers and shelters to man the step and repel. � flame-trooper lubba fifteen regiments of alliance troops assaulted the line in the wake of the barrage. a wave attack, welling up from the smoke-skeined darkness of no-man's-land. the twenty-kilometre stretch of line had been lit up for half an hour by the salvos of the bombardment. after a moment's eerie silence, it lit up again. small-arms. machine guns. grenades. flamers. from the air, the wide band of massive light bursts reduced to a thinner, fizzling line of fire. it was the most significant attack mounted on the shadik line in eighteen months. an offensive, the officers of the gsc were calling it back in the safety of the rear-line bunkers. lyntor-sewq and martane had been prepping for it since lyntor-sewq's promotion to supreme commander. lyntor-sewq had dearly wanted to make his mark early, and prove to the high sezar how lax his predecessor, count golke, had been in his accomplishments. it was all part of a greater strategy that incorporated the northern push through gibsgatte, where the supreme commander had invested the bulk of his imperial guard armour. the idea was to sucker punch shadik by a northern thrust and then take him hard in the belly at the pocket and bassin-on-naeme. lyntor-sewq's overall scheme was to divert the enemy's strengths to the north and retake the river valley, establishing a new front he called the frergarten line before winter set in. if successful, the peinforq line would become obsolete for the first time in twenty-six years. over winter, the new line could be reinforced using alliance troops, and be ready by spring not only to hold against the inevitable counter-push, but also to launch an invasion of the southern republic, in concerted effort with the kottmark armies on the ostlund line. it was an over-ambitious scheme, typical of a new commander trying to be emphatic and break the deadlock apparently imposed by his predecessor. if golke had been privy to the planning meetings, he'd have been able to tell lyntor-sewq frankly that the same thing had been tried before, three times, in point of fact. if ibram gaunt had been privy to the planning meetings, his comments would have been earthier still. lyntor-sewq was playing the war like a game of regicide. the first thing a commander learns that's of any use at all is that army groups do not behave like playing pieces. unfortunately, neither officer was present at the meetings. by the time it was getting too late to advise lyntor- sewq differently, both gaunt and golke, the latter by choice, were at the sharp end of things. van voytz was at the meetings, most of them anyway. his counselling efforts were completely eclipsed by the determination of the new supreme commander. when, months later. van voytz finally withdrew from aexe cardinal, he would come to regard his time there as the most frustrating and impotent of his career. most gsc staffers believed that this particular night had been chosen to launch the offensive because of the opening the counter-strike at 57th had provided. its success had jibed in a timely way with the frontal press at gibsgatte. this was only partially true. though gaunt never learned the truth, the offensive had been launched because of redjacq ankre. discovering, from logged notes, that the first was infiltrating that night, he'd persuaded martane to put the call in. ankre was a proud man. his pride would eventually cost him his life, many years later. he hated the idea that the tanith could have found an opening, and he used that hate to fuel his persuasive powers. if the stealthers of the first could break the shadik line, then so could the alliance ground forces. ankre was actually afraid that the off-worlders of the guard might actually achieve something that the alliance had failed to do. he could not stomach the idea. he personified the emotion-led failing of the alliance top brass, a failing that had prolonged this war by decades. as with all efforts of such scale, his failing went unnoticed in the general scheme of things. almost three thousand alliance troops fell casualty on the line assault that night. no figure, not even an estimation, was made for the shadik forces. at one stretch of the line, one hundred and seventy-eight men of the genswick foot, including lieutenant fevrierson, became encumbered in lines of wire and were slaughtered by machine guns. at another section, no more than fifty metres long, three hundred fichuan infantrymen died in the storm charge.  the trench filled up, level with the surrounding terrain, packed with bodies so deeply the shadik were forced to fall back and hold a reserve trench. trench mortars killed sixty men of the meuport fifth as they came towards the parapet and were illuminated by starshells sent up by a nearby bransgatte unit who had become disoriented. the surviving men of the meuport fifth later took the fire trench, held it for an hour, lost it again and then retook it before dawn. the action entered their regimental legend. at the northern tip of the assault, a detachment of strathid cavalry overran the held position under cover of autocannons, and stormed the main reserve trench. then a counter-strike of gas shells and nail grenades broke their sturdy advance and left them dead and dying. hussars, individually untouched, lay twitching and screaming in the foggy dark, sharing through the mind-links the death-throes of their wounded mounts. alliance troopers advancing through the area started to mercy kill the birds, and then found themselves, in tearful desperation, mercy killing the hussars too. they could not bear the screams. the kottstadt wyverns, under major benedice, assaulted, took and held a kilometre stretch of fire trench, and then storm-fought their way back down the communication alleys to secure a line of gun-pits. ninety-three men were incinerated when a high explosive dump was enthusiastically flamed, blowing a hole in the earth two hundred metres in diameter. the rest of them, along with a fair number of wyverns, subsequently died in the clouds of toxic gas that spewed from storage pits ruptured by the main blast. all the while, set far back, the shadik super-siege guns continued to bombard. their immense shells broke shield umbrellas on the peinforq line, and obliterated an ammunition dump, a command bunker, nineteen artillery stations � including five heavy howitzer mounts � a sector infirmary and a reserve trench full of young, conscripted fichuans who thought they'd managed to skip the war for a night. some of the massive shells even struck peinforq itself. the manorial house was destroyed, and the abattoir, along with the burial chapel, two cafes, and a street of billet-housing full of krassian troopers. despite the monumental losses, the alliance offensive didn't lose momentum that night, or the day after. lyntor- sewq, determined to press for the victory he saw beckoning, deployed greater and greater numbers into the push until it ran out of steam on the fourth day and he conceded defeat. but for gaunt's mission, that was in the unknowable future. by midnight on that first night of offensive, they were a kilometre inside the shadik lines, following a supply trench. all hell was breaking loose behind them at the shadik front, lighting up the sky and filling the valley with smoke fumes. but they were pushing forward, silent, relentless, into the depths of the enemy fortifications. corpse light broke above them, white and pale. more flares. the roar of the battle was distant and muffled. they'd just slaughtered twelve shadik infantrymen in their fifth skirmish of the night. the first had suffered no losses so far, but gaunt wondered how much longer they would be able to work with blades alone. the sound of the siege guns was deafening now, even though they were still several kilometres away. the ground vibrated, not from impacts but from firing. gaunt sighed and looked around. the supply trench system they were in was dark and quiet. everything had been pushed towards the front. once in a while, shadik personnel appeared, and were knifed to silence by the ghosts. but gaunt knew they'd been lucky. all it would take was for them to meet an advancing brigade head on. then it would come down to firepower. firepower and numbers. if only they had a decent fix on the guns. something concrete to take back with them. he'd told them all that locate was the minimum requirement of the mission. two or three kilometres to the north-east wasn't precise enough. round the next traverse of the supply trench, they found themselves in a deep ammunition corridor laid with track. it was twice the width of the infantry burrows, and ran northeast, dead straight. the feeder roads for the big guns. wide enough to take the girth of the shells on munition trains. they were dosing on it. a rifle cracked, twice. trooper sekko convulsed and fell. gaunt looked back and saw shadik elements emerging from the gloom, weapons blazing. the ghosts returned fire, lasguns cracking. lubba spat fire down the wide space of the ammunition corridor. the game was up. they'd been rumbled. � rerval looked up from the micro-bead set he'd been playing with. caffran looked feygor in the eyes. he looked round at the others. they were all watching the exchange. brostin and cuu began to head for the door. they stopped in their tracks. and you can stick it. mkvenner asked me to secure this place until he got back. so that's what i'm doing. a strong-point. asked gutes. said feygor. he looked at brostin and cuu. brostin shrugged. he looked uncomfortable. feygor scratched his neck. the idea of running clearly appealed to him but he was considering the consequences. if trouble was that close, they'd stand a better chance of survival here as a group than alone and moving through the forest. for now. prepare for con-tart. caffran, get everyone deployed. gutes grinned. he scanned the woods again. it began to rain, lightly at first and then with greater force. despite the rain, the mist refused to budge. the light ebbed as it became overcast, and the early morning seemed like wet twilight. there was no signal on the beads. caffran began to wonder if he'd imagined it. all fully kitted and prepped, the members of the detail took station to cover the back of the manse. caffran was set up in the greenhouse, one of the western most outhouses running off the back yard, with a good angle across the rear lawn, and a decent view left into the patch of kitchen garden behind the pantry. he and rerval had strengthened the defences in the greenhouse with packing crates, earth-filled sacking and part of an old iron bedstead they'd found on a bonfire heap. they'd carefully knocked out the last of the glass panels. east of him, across the mouth of the yard area, cuu was crouching in place at the end of a long barricade muril and larkin had built from fence timbers and corrugated iron sheets. they'd had to dismantle several of the lean-tos to cannibalize for material. rerval was positioned further along the same barricade, hunched in the corner it made with the stone wall of the old coal bunker. brostin was sitting on a chair just inside the half-open kitchen door, his flamer broom across his lap, his tanks beside him. he checked the power cells of the two laspistols � his and feygof's �that he carried as small-arms. feygor, his rifle primed, was a few metres away at the main kitchen window. a thick wall separated him from gutes, who was in the dining room, dug-in at the rear window overlooking the coal house and the hedges of the side ditch. larkin was on station on the first floor above them all, using a bedroom window as his fire point. muril, insisting she was the closest thing they had to a scout, was up at the top of the rear lawn in the derelict sheds at the end of the garden wall. she knelt, perfectly still, watching the trees. about twenty minutes earlier, as they'd ran final checks before taking up station, rerval had found the missing trans-mission circuit on the kitchen table. assuming that it was feygor, or one of feygor's cronies, who'd left it there for him to find, rerval made little fuss. they were all in this together now and there was no point racking up the tension any more. he'd fitted it back into the caster and, after consulting with feygor, sent a message back to ins arbor. position, situation, the prospect of enemy contact. ironically, there had been no reply, apart from a few strangulated whines of static. rerval didn't know if it was atmospherics or some slip-up he'd made repairing the vox. there was no time to strip it out and start again. he prayed company command had heard him. he prayed there'd be help coming. failing help, he hoped that a warning had got through.  in the damp, mouldering back bedroom, larkin settled himself on the pungent mattress he'd pulled up to lie on, and rested his long-las on the paint-flaked sill. he shook out his neck, tried to ignore the pain clawing into his brain from the top of the spine and across the back of his head, and scoped up. his swollen face ached as he pushed it against the eyepiece. his cracked rib stung and he had to alter his stance. he had a good sweep of the entire back lawn. he panned the rifle around, taking distance readings off the various features: the end sheds, the sundial at the centre of the lawn, the coal bunker, caff's greenhouse. down below him, in the yard, he saw cuu crouching at the barricade with his back to him. larkin turned the rifle down and took aim on cuu. no more than fifteen metres. clear. an easy shot. target-fix. larkin's fingers twitched on the trigger. not yet. but maybe soon. if there was shooting, if there was a fight, he'd take cuu and damn the consequences. he'd take cuu cuu's way: in battle, when no one would know. what was it that little bastard had said? war's a messy thing, tanith. confused and all shit like that. middle of combat, all crap flying this way and that. who's gonna notice if i get my payback? you'd just be another body in the count. good advice, lijah cuu. good advice. rainwater dripped from the shed roof and hit muril's cheek with a plick. she wiped it away, and then realised it wasn't the drip that had made the noise. her micro-bead had tapped. jajjo! stand by. report! he asked. he peered out. twenty, maybe thirty of them. they're right behind me. contact! muril! muril! report! feygor said. caffran heard the signal too and his blood ran cold. they'd met the blood part before, on phantine. the part was the devoted vanguard of the arch-enemy. not cultists, not rebels. drilled and trained infantry, highly motivated, highly skilled and well equipped. if they were here, fighting for the republic � well, that meant a forty year old war had just changed as radically as it had done when the guard arrived in support of the alliance. this had ceased to be a global matter. now it was well and truly part of the crusade. from his position, all he could see was the back of the outhouse and the sprays of tile and stone smashing off it under the heavy fire. he yearned for a target. feygor urged over the link. the hell with that! muril and jajjo were dead meat if no one took up the fight. feygor clearly didn't want to give away the fact that a unit was dug-in here. not until he had to. a slightly different noise now rose from the beleaguered outhouse. the whine-crack, higher-pitched, of first one imperial lasrifle, then another. muril and jajjo were returning fire. feygor snarled over the link. the overcharged sniper-round zapped off up the length of the garden and blew out the head of one blood part trooper in a sideways spray of blood, tissue and metal. his almost headless body toppled over into the ferns. the others started running for cover. target-fix. seventy-three metres. another head shot. the blood part trooper flew off his feet, his legs kicking slackly up into the air as he cartwheeled. holy feth! won't any of you take a fething order? negative she and jajjo were pinned down behind the narrow stone wall, and cannon fire was gradually creeping their way. they needed a break, enough time to run back down the lawn to the main house. first thing you learn get up with larkin! bellowed the young man. jajjo realised the youth was tied to his chair jajjo got up, went across to the boy, and cut his bonds with his dagger. the young man � jajjo realised how dirty and unshaven he was � darted across to the field dressing kit gutes had left on the bench seat. he recovered it and ran over to join the old woman cradling rerval. an astonishingly wide pool of blood had spread out under her. jajjo asked. las-fire flickered up and down the lawn, fierce and heavy. caffran thought he'd scored another hit but it was hard to tell. there were at least a dozen shooters up there. muril arrived on the first floor, and tried to find the window with the best sweep. she could hear the hot-shot whine of larkin's weapon from nearby. larkin reloaded again and took aim.  he'd switched bedrooms three rimes since the fight had begun so his shots didn't come from the same place each time. in the far end bedroom, he knelt and sighted. a steel helmet over a grotesque iron mask. bang! the blood pact trooper fell. larkin reloaded. he hunted for targets. the back of his skull hurt worse than ever, and he could taste blood. every now and then, his vision faltered. the blizzard of las-fire coming down at them was almost overwhelming. middle of combat, all crap flying this way and that� larkin stroked his long-las and tilted the aim down. lijah cuu was below him in the yard, firing away up hill. the scope's crosshairs made a luminous frame around the back of cuu's head. larkin paused. he breathed carefully. his head was really aching now, that terrible stabbing migraine that had haunted him all his life. he blinked away sweat. he would fething do this. cuu, right in his sights. lijah cuu. his nemesis. the embodiment of his fear. the man who had killed try again bragg. one shot. pop. easy. larkin's finger tightened on the trigger. target-fix. cuu. nine point seven metres. larkin whined aloud, a pitiful sound. he wanted to do it, yet he couldn't. he was a sniper, a marksman, a killer. but not a murderer. he couldn't shoot one of their own in the back, even if it was lijah fething cuu. he wanted to. he had to. it was the only way. it was why he'd come. but� cuu would have done it without hesitation, larkin thought. his head was truly spinning now. his vision was closing in with flashes and lumps of colour. she was right. he was so fething glad he hadn't stained his soul the way cuu had stained his. there was honour. there was morality. there was sleeping at night without waking up screaming. bragg would understand. wherever he was, bragg would understand. larkin turned and took a last look out of his scope. cuu was looking right back at them. lijah cuu saw the aimed rifle. and smiled. brostin and caffran finally drove the last of the pacters back from the left hand flank of the house. feygor and gutes smacked shots against the rear wall, and feygor hit another body. then the blood pact fell silent. the ghosts waited. no contact. no sound. larkin had already passed out on the mattress. watery blood wept into the padding behind his head. down below, she could hear feygor and the others repairing defences and reloading for the next wave. she'd heard a sound from the front of the house. she took up her lasgun and went out onto the landing. another tiny sound, a movement at the porch. she went down the staircase slowly, gun raised. at the foot of the stairs, she wheeled round, and found herself aiming at cuu. he winked at her. she covered him with her weapon. � warmaster slaydo, from a treatise on the nature of warfare firebreathing, like the giant creatures of old myth, the monsters lay before them. when the monsters roared, the ground shook and the air came past hot and acrid, in a pressurised shockwave. the light flashes were painful and immense, like grounded stars being switched on and off in the night. the sound shook teeth and bone and marrow. the battle in the ammunition corridor had taken seven minutes to conclude in the ghosts' favour. squaring off against a shadik battalion of slightly greater size, gaunt's infiltration group had lost five men � four ghosts and one of golke's bande sezari troopers. but their superior weaponry and, in gaunt's opinion, far superior battlecraft had left nearly thirty shadik troopers dead. broken, the rest had fallen back. undoubtedly, the shadik commanders knew they had intruders now. despite the open invitation to the siege guns' location offered by the corridor, gaunt and mkoll had pulled the mission team off east into a muddy, trackless wasteland beyond. the area was lightless and cold, rambling with old lines of wire and jumbles of wreckage. weeds and thorny scrub grew in dumps and thickets, sprouting around the split rockcrete of old pill boxes and between the axles of rusted trucks. this was an old battlefield, years old, that the war had passed over and left behind. now it was just dead ground in the hinterland of the republican line. the ghosts advanced silently through the dark terrain, heading north, towards the titanic blasts of the guns. they kept the ammunition corridor just in sight to their left, and moved parallel to its course. there would be troops out searching for them. gaunt was sure of that. even with the huge offensive going on, drawing on shadik manpower, the enemy commanders would not allow a suspected infiltration so close to their super-guns to go unchecked. on three occasions, the ghosts dropped down into cover when the scouts alerted them to shadik patrols in the corridor. gaunt didn't need another stand-up fight at this stage. better to hide and wait and move on once the jeopardy had passed. the night sky was amber, tinged by the vast doughnut of smoke drifting out from the guns. on occasions, they glimpsed the moon, an orange semi-circle dancing in and out of the bars of cloudy exhaust. nearly three hours after they had first emerged from the mill tunnel, they came up to a ridge that overlooked the guns. the monsters. it was physically hard to observe them directly. for the last forty minutes the imperials had been trudging through a wasteland made spectral by the almighty flashes going off beyond the black horizon. they had almost become acclimatised to the noise and the light and the trembling soil. but looking on the guns was virtually impossible. the flashes seared eyesight, leaving idiot repeats glowing on the back of the eyelids. the shockwaves came like slaps. the discharge blasts felt like they were exploding eardrums. beltayn reported that the pulse shock had killed all vox-links.  lying on his side on the earth near the top of the ridge, with the men spread out below him, gaunt pondered his next move. he felt frustration gnawing at him. they'd got so close, against all expectations except his own, and now they couldn't go the last distance. it was like one of the myths he'd read as a child in the scholam progenium. monsters so ghastly that the very breath or sight of them blinded men and turned them to stone. he adjusted his data-slate and took a compass bearing. at least now he had accomplished something. the precise location of the siege guns was known to them. without other options to hand, their imperative now was to get that information back to gsc. and that meant physically, with the vox dead. gaunt turned to mkoll and the sergeants and used verghast scratch-company sign language to communicate his intention to pull back and break out. halfway through, a chillingly eerie thing happened. darkness and silence fell. it wasn't complete silence. the distant, frenzied commotion of the offensive was now audible, and it wasn't true darkness either because of the ambient background firelight. but the guns had stopped firing. gaunt crawled back to the top of the ridge. what he had only vaguely glimpsed before was now laid out below him. the monster guns, each one set on a huge rail cart, their massive barrels, the size of manufactory chimneys, elevated to the sky. there were seven of them, just like bonin had insisted. smoke lay thick like ground fog around them, blurring their shapes and distorting the bare white glow of the chemical lanterns strung up around the area. gaunt saw figures moving around, gun-crew dwarfed by the huge railway cannons. electric hoists and flatbed loading carts, which had been occupied serving shells into the automatic arming mechanisms, were now busy clearing unused shells and propellant-mix cartridges clear of the firing site. some laden carts were being attached to a greasy shunting engine that began puffing them away down the ammunition corridor. even dormant, the massive guns and their riveted steel cars looked invincible. oil and condensation dripped from their huge shock-absorber pylons and clung in glittering droplets to the taut wires of the warping winches. the shells alone were taller than a man. the ghosts had proved their bravery, tenacity and ability to golke without doubt, but what could they, with lasrifles or even tube-charges, do against such juggernauts? golke nodded. he asked. they broke into four groups roughly along platoon lines. mkoll's unit would move up, skirting the firing site, and wire the track sections north of the guns. gaunt allowed him ten minutes' head start to get into position. domor's squad went east, to rig the ammunition corridor's line. arcuda's dropped back west and right of the ridge to set their charges along the southern stretch. gaunt stayed with criid's platoon and the elements of raglon's on the ridge, ready to provide fire support if things woke up. ideally, the blasts should happen pretty much simultaneously. co-ordination was hard without the vox. gaunt had them synchronise their timepieces. the deadline was at 04.00 hours. charges should be laid by then. at 04.00, each team leader would fire a red starshell to signal readiness, then gaunt would fire a white shell to order detonation. if any reds hadn't fired by that time, then gaunt would wait two minutes. after that, it was white flare anyway and pull out. they agreed a rendezvous back in the deadlands. we can always improvise if we have to. the emperor protects, so serve him well. the cover team broke from the ridge and came down the slope, guns blazing. the shadik unit faltered, suddenly under fire from their left. the ghosts ripped into them. gaunt was right in the middle of it. his boltgun howled and blew an enemy infantryman apart. his majestic blade, the power sword of heironymo sondar, gifted to him in gratitude by the people of vervunhive, flickered with blue lightning. beside him, beltayn was firing from the shoulder as he ran, thumping bright las-bolts into the greatcoated enemy. beyond beltayn, criid was urging her ghosts on, deploying them in right groups even in the melee of an impromptu charge. i made a good choice in tona, gaunt thought. a second later, a shadik battlettooper was in his face, lunging with a serrated bayonet. gaunt deflected with the sword, shearing off the front half of the man's gun and an arm with it. a bolt-round settled the man right behind him. lubba's flamer roared and lit up the night. gaunt saw two shadik lurching away, burning from head to toe. hwlan, vulli and kolea laid in side by side. kolea seemed to have forgotten how a lasrifle worked. he was scything into the enemy with his bayonet fixed, reaping them down like com stalks, hacking like a miner at an ore-face. it was a blur of frantic, face-to-face killing. golke blasted with his revolver until it was empty, and then grabbed up a shadik submachine-gun that had fallen on the gravel of the track bed. one of the bande sezari men beside him convulsed as rifle rounds tore through him. golke swung round and cracked away with the compact weapon, knocking three of the enemy troopers off their feet. raglon yelled above the din of combat. gaunt could see another company of shadik troopers streaming out of the eastern trench-head to reinforce the first. grenades blared and flashed in the night. domor's squad had been pinned down and then driven off by the first fusillades. beltayn yelled. gaunt looked up and saw two red starshells fading away. in the frenzy of it all, he'd almost missed the signals from mkoll and arcuda. two out of three. good enough. it would have to do. he bellowed, and fired the white flare. as soon as the corpse light of the white signal bloomed above them, a hot yellow burst exploded to the north, and then another, seconds later, to the west. the cover team, firing behind them as they went, battled up the ridge and back into the darkness of the wasteland. they left the sidings and track beds littered with shadik dead. gaunt checked his bearings by the luminous dial of his compass. domor looked forlorn with disappointment. gaunt gripped him by the shoulders. shadik troopers were milling around the firing site, and spreading out down the lines, surveying the damage with lanterns. two huge craters marred the tracks, one on each side of the siege gun emplacement. more troopers, muffled in their heavy, drab coats and trench armour, shambled south down the corridor line, picking over the bodies. one called for an officer as he found the half-laid tube-charges between the sleepers. count golke crouched behind the bogies of the munition cart, barely twenty metres from the nearest enemy soldier. he watched as they grouped around and cut apart the wires connecting the tube-bombs, pulling them off the tracks. the officer waved a hand and barked orders, sending a squad of about ten down to check the cart. the troopers approached, rifles ready, the lamplight glinting off their helmets and bayonets. golke limped round the back end of the cart. it was actually a linked line of three, laden with propellant cartridges, waiting for the next shunting engine to move in and pull it down to the armoured magazines. golke climbed up onto the middle cart. it was hard work with his hip. he winced and grunted. the bullet wound in his chest made it harder still. he got onto the top, and sat down between the canister hoppers. he smiled. he'd come back into the pocket, faced his demons, and come through it. now he was going to his victory too. it was due him. what he'd failed to achieve as a commander, he would do as a trooper. the enemy soldiers were around the carts now. he could hear their voices. one called out. he'd found the trail of golke's blood. golke heard more voices, and boots clunking on rungs of the cart's metal side ladder. those shadik voices. the voices of the enemy. golke wished the whole war could have been as simple as this. he coughed, and blood welled out of his mouth and down his chin. a shadik called out, he'd heard the cough. golke caught the sound of bolt-actions cranking. he lifted up the tube-charge. it was the only one he'd been able to tear free from the tangle domor's team had wired to the tracks. there'd been no time for more. he wasn't sure how it worked, but there was a paper tab on the top that looked like an igniter strip. he felt footsteps on the body of the track. a shadik trooper appeared around the side of the right hand hopper and called out as he saw golke lying there. the tube fired. canisters around ruptured. propellant cartridges ignited. the blast lit up the valley for a moment. one hundred metres of ammunition corridor and the land around it vanished in a geyser of flame. � piet gutes the sky was full of stars. they were pink, and vaguely oblong. on the horizon, sheaves of white fireworks danced and burst, like the firecrackers of a victory parade. the air was pulsing with a strange humming sound, like a moaning human voice swimming in and out of hearing. a dark shadow suddenly eclipsed the stars. he obeyed, moving. the strange sky, with its ghastly, wrong stars, drained away. he smelled cold air and heard the patter of heavy rain close by. try again bragg smiled his big, genial smile. larkin blinked and sat up quickly. the movement made him dizzy and he felt nausea rise through him. the hind part of his brain felt like someone was repeatedly clubbing it with a nine-seventy, spike first. at the edges of his vision, obscure lights danced and fire crackers burst. he was on the dirty mattress in a damp bedroom of the manse. rain sheeted down outside, accompanied by lightning. it was late afternoon. apart from the rainstorm, things had been quiet since they'd driven the assault back first thing. they'd repaired the defences, and added a few more at mkvenner's suggestion. the scout explained how he and jajjo had run across the blood pact unit late the previous night. a fair-sized patrol force, which mkvenner was certain was just the spearhead of a larger advance. shadik had been reinforced from off-world by the elite infantry of the arch-enemy, and the first action of that elite had been to pave the way for an invasion through the montorq forest. ironic, caffran thought, that both chaos and imperial elements had brought the same advice to the warring nations of aexe cardinal. rerval was stable, thanks to the deserter's field aid, though weak from loss of blood. they put him in the drawing room out of the way, and caffran asked peterik to look after him. no one complained that peterik wasn't tied up anymore. the old woman sat with them and banked up the drawing room fire. with rerval out of commission, mkvenner operated the vox-caster, and sent a more detailed repeat of the original message. again, there was no reply. there was still no way of telling if anyone had heard either warning. then we fething well leave them! i know, tough. i don't like it. but aren't we obliged to carry a warning back now? i mean, the vox is probably down. mkvenner frowned. he didn't want to get into his thoughts on the subject of murtan feygor and failure of duty. so, we maintain the defence of this place. for as long as we can. caffran, muril and jajjo looked solemn. feygor shook his head. gutes sat down, tutting. brostin growled an unhappy curse. mkvenner replied. he'd suggested the plan. jajjo left by the front door, into the rain and the bad light. and jajjo was gone. mkvenner shut and bolted the front door. feygor was already deploying the remaining members of the detail to fire positions. he sent muril to the first floor, to check what shape larkin was in and take up a sniping position. but for the record� for what that's worth� i've been impressed with your work from the moment you signed up. jajjo needed a bit of extra coaching to make the grade. she disappeared. he turned back to his scope. for a moment, he couldn't see the garden or the fringe of woods at all. just oblong pink stars and firecrackers. he blinked, then blinked again, until his vision cleared. half an hour later, the blood pact returned. in the makeshift pillbox of the greenhouse, caffran thought he saw movement in the rain, and craned his head up over the edge of the old bedstead and the sacking. he heard a noise. a hollow puff followed by a whine. then another. then yet another. fall back! caff, fall back! he shouted back. under cover of the furious mortar and cannon fire, the troopers began their assault. caffran glimpsed red-dad figures pouring in through the rubble at the back of the lawn, some crawling along the side ditches or below what was left of the back wall. now small-arms fire came their way too. he waited as long as he dared, until enemy shapes had almost reached the sundial half-way down the lawn. he yanked the twine in his hand. the cord was tied off to the det-tapes of their remaining tubes, buried in the lawn itself. they went off in rapid series, hurling two or three bodies into the air. satisfied, caffran leapt up, and scrambled out through the back of the greenhouse into the yard. las-rounds flew past him. a mortar bomb exploded in the kitchen garden off to his left, and then another hit the greenhouse squarely. the blast threw him onto his face. mkvenner dashed across to him and dragged him back towards the kitchen doorway where brostin was covering them. cuu had already run inside out of the deluge. mkvenner got caffran into the kitchen as two more mortar shells hit the barricade and the remains of the coal bunker. stone fragments peppered the back wall of the manse. everyone firing from a window ducked. mkvenner snapped at caffran. caffran was dazed, and his shoulders and the backs of his legs were covered in shrapnel cuts. mkvenner said. the house shook as another mortar struck it. broken tiles avalanched down into the yard. there were blood pact troopers all over the rear lawn now, coming in low on the far side of the barricade and the shredded greenhouse. thick smoke and the flash of explosions fogged most of the view. the ghosts fired at every target they could make out. from the first floor, muril and larkin were making the best of the kills. feygor bellowed, blasting from the main kitchen window. cuu leapt up and ran. gutes yelled over the link from the dining room. mkvenner moved to the kitchen door and peered out east. he snarled. gutes sang back. mkvenner ran back along the hall from the kitchen, and unbolted the front door. the house vibrated with the rattle of gunfire and the batter of the mortars. the pots and pans on the stairs were quivering and spilling their contents as the whole manse shook. he felt a particularly loud bang that sounded like a mortar had taken the roof in. mkvenner realised it was simply the thunder splitting right overhead. he got the door open and edged out into the rain, weapon up, moving round the eastern side of the building. the roar of battle floated round from the rear. the blood pact was already tearing through the ditch hedge into the front lawn area. one spotted mkvenner, but the scout shot him dead before he could raise either weapon or cry. he fired again. two more toppled backwards into the hedge, arms flailing. three more opened fire, and mkvenner was forced to dodge back into the cover of the porch. las-rounds whirred off the stone porch posts. from cover, he managed to hit two of the attackers and then made a dash for the hedge, hoping to cut off the ditch with an enfilade. a grenade tumbled through the rain. mkvenner threw himself out of the way, but still the blast lifted him and slammed him into the long, wet grass of the lawn. he came round again moments later to see an iron mask leering at him, and a blade striking at his throat. mkvenner rolled and kicked his legs round, smashing the blood pact trooper over. another one lunged at the tanith with his bayonet, but mkvenner grabbed the barrel, wrenched it out of the enemy's hands, and killed him with a savage blow using the stock. a las-round cracked at him from point-blank range, but mkvenner had crouched low, and came up, scything the bayonet of the captured weapon through the belly of the third attacker. without looking , he planted a kick backwards, breaking the neck of the first man, who was now trying to get up from the grass. but there were more of them, so many more. almost a dozen, rushing him, some firing. he sidestepped another bayonet, and a las-round ripped through his right thigh. fuelled with pain, he rammed the blade of his borrowed rifle through the neck of the closest invader. full auto las-fire tore across the lawn, making trails of steam in the downpour. three blood pacters fell immediately, then a fourth. mkvenner opened fire with his lasrifle and took out two more before turning and sprinting for the porch. in the porch doorway, peterik stood, blasting furiously with rerval's lasgun. full auto. the remaining blood pact exposed on the lawn either died or fled. mkvenner tumbled in beside him. at the rear, a series of mortar rounds had struck the yard and blown paving slabs through the kitchen wall. another two shells had slammed into the pantry, already a ruin.  caffran and feygor were down behind the cast-iron bulk of the stove, firing through the shattered hole that had once been the main window. the kitchen door had been blown off its hinges, but brostin was in the doorway, revving his flamer. a trio of blood pact troops leapt the barricade and charged the kitchen. brostin hosed them and they torched in their tracks, the grenades they carried blowing out and showering the fractured yard with metal chips, pieces of gristle and burning scraps of fabric. brostin nursed the flamer, and sent a second flare right over the barricade, sizzling in the rain. they could hear screams. an enemy trooper, burning across his back and legs, ran hopelessly towards the greenhouse and fell when feygor shot him. brostin had an infamous affinity with fire. now the enemy was in range, he started bursting sprays of liquid flame up over the barricade and the wall of the kitchen garden, sliding it round angles that las-rounds couldn't touch. he washed the jumbled wood of the felled green house with a blanket of warm, orange fire, blistering the old paint and cooking the wood, and then ignited the toasted kindling with a spear of blue, super-hot fire. another enemy voice rose up in a scream. a blizzard of touched-off grenades added to the raging fire. the mortar rounds still thumped in. caffran flinched as he heard one go through the roof. cannon fire raked the back wall, splitting exposed brickwork and stone. the manse's original lime wash render had long since been shot away. screamed larkin, trying to struggle free. cuu's hands twisted at the fracture in the back of his skull and he gagged and howled. blood spurted from larkin's nostrils. what, you little tanith gak-face? the right time? that's funny, sure as sure. cuu wrenched at larkin's head again, and the sniper threw up. cuu shoved him off onto the mattress. larkin tried to move, but the oblong pink stars filled his vision, merged into one huge firecracker that blasted through his mind. he went into spasms. his back arched and his eyes rolled back until they were just bloodshot whites. blood spattered as he bit his tongue. as the seizure smashed through his stringy body and limbs, he made an unearthly groan. cuu stepped back for a second in disgust. he drew his blade. looks like i'll be doing you a favour, you freak. muril spat. she stood in the doorway of the bedroom, her lasrifle aimed at cuu's scarsplit face. she edged towards him. cuu rose, grinned his grin. corbec wandered up through the trees towards the smoking shell of the old, lonely house. to his left, light tanks and clanking sentinels of the krassian armoured ploughed up the valley through the trees, lending fire support to the first fire-teams corbec had sent in ahead of him. a fairly serious firefight was occurring in the woods behind the house. commissar hark trudged back to meet him. i know that, hark. varl was waiting for him at the battered porch of the manse. enemy dead littered the lawn. an old woman � corbec had no idea who the feth she was � was kneeling on the gravel path and weeping over the body of a young alliance soldier. on the steps of the porch, a krassian corpsman was treating a tanith trooper for multiple injuries. he was shouting out for a medic as he worked. the tanith man was so covered in blood he was unrecognisable at first. a bad leg wound, a gut shot, a scalp wound, something messy through the left shoulder. corbec ignored varl and knelt down beside the man. he said, looking up at the frantic corpsman. tell me. how bad? looks like he gave a good account of himself. rerval's alive. took a hit to the face in an earlier phase of action. he'd missed his vox man these last few days. corbec pushed past the sergeant and walked up the steps into the house. in the doorway, he paused and glanced back at varl. there was a lot of commotion around the house. not the same sort of commotion that had all but demolished it, but still. troop carriers were gliding up. krassian tanks were churning up over the lawns and into the woods. there was a gak of a fight going on up there in the trees. not his problem anymore. lijah cuu sat on an old bench at the side of the front lawn and watched it all. he licked the blood from the straight silver of his warknife and slid it away into its scabbard. �demarchese, on the use of armies a week later, in the dismal streets of gibsgatte, more rain fell. colonel-commissar ibram gaunt, still limping slightly from the rifle-round that had scraped him during the sixhour break-out from the shadik lines, came up the steps of the sezaria, a gold-domed building that dominated the skyline of the dirty northern city. bande sezari sentries at the door checked his papers and then bowed to admit him, the struthid plumes in their caps touching the floor. gaunt nodded to them with genuine respect. he knew who the bande sezari were now. he'd seen several of them fight to the last. an alliance adjutant escorted him up three flights and along a splendid corridor of gilt-framed paintings. lyntor-sewq was a thin, bald man with a plucked moustache and limpid eyes. many doubted you, gaunt. you and the imperials. of course, we were grateful for your intervention. but still� lyntor-sewq chuckled. lyntor-sewq smiled. new orders. from the warmaster, relayed by the astropathicus. your regiment is being retasked. gaunt looked at the slate. he felt a peculiar sense of shock. he'd never been pulled out of a warzone before the fighting was done. in his opinion, there was still a year or more of bloodshed to go on aexe cardinal before the imperium could claim victory. macaroth was pulling the tanith first out. it was like ending in the middle of things. according to the slate, elements of the second crusade army were moving in to replace them and finish the job. and his heart skipped when he saw the destination the ghosts were heading to. he reached into his desk and produced a slim, oblong box covered in gold-flecked blue satin. lyntor-sewq opened it. a gold aquila, pinned to a white silk ribbon, lay in the cushioned interior. gaunt had seen one before, pinned proudly to iaco fep golke's coat. he dearly wanted to take the medal and stuff it into lyntor-sewq's throat until he choked. or at least refuse it. but he knew the trouble that would follow if he did either. he allowed the supreme commander to pin it on him, and saluted. he'd wear it now, and never again. the motor car roared off from the long steps and turned into gibsgatte's cross-town traffic, heading south. in the back of the car, gaunt stripped the brown paper off the parcel. inside was an old edition of a book. gaunt smiled, despite the deep misgivings aching through his heart. i salvaged it from the lord general's library and i'm sure he won't miss it. all i know is, sir, this is the place. gaunt got out of the car the woodland looked familiar, very familiar. he was sure beltayn was right. there just wasn't a chapel there anymore. there was no trace of the chapel of the holy light abundant, veniq. nothing, except the lingering perfume of a particular flower. beltayn stepped over to join him. beltayn shivered. all along the 58th sector of the peinforq line, the word was spreading. the ghosts were being pulled out. enervated, daur went down the line, distributing marshalling orders to the platoons. they were to pull back the following night to the cathedral city of ghrennes and await navy collection. the orders didn't say where they were heading, but all the troops were excited. it sounded significant. and most of them were just desperate to get out of the trench horror of aexe. daur was torn. he wanted to see the first out of the murderous front line, but he was going to miss the xo role. ana curth had told him that rawne was almost fit. in a day or two, the major would return to duty.  daur conveyed the orders dutifully, getting the regiment to prep for off-lift. he got haller's platoon roused up, then obel's. then he walked down the zagging trench to soric's command post. ghosts leaving. late in the sixteenth year of the sabbat worlds crusade, warmaster macaroth's incisive advance on the strategically vital cabal system, which had been so strong and confident in its initial phase, juddered to a halt. three-quarters of the target planets, including two of the infamous fortress-worlds, had been taken by imperial crusade forces and the occupying armies of the chaos archenemy routed or put to flight. warmaster macaroth hastily redeployed significant elements of his spinward flank in a make or break effort to open up new lines of supply. �sgt. varl, 1st team leader, tanith first a choke-hold was the last thing he expected. trooper hlaine larkin landed with a jarring thump in a place so dark he couldn't even see his hand in front of his face. he immediately got right down like the colonel had told him in practice. belly down. somewhere in the dark, to his right, he heard sergeant obel scolding the men in the fireteam to hug cover. that was a joke for starters. cover? how could they find cover when they couldn't even see the arse of the man in front? larkin lay down on his front and reached about until his fingers found an upright surface. a stanchion, maybe. a bulkhead. he slithered towards it, and then unshipped his long-las from its soft plastic cover. that he could do by touch alone. his fingers ran along the nalwood furniture, the firing mechanism, the oiled top-slot ready to take his nightscope. someone cried out in the darkness nearby. some poor feth who'd snapped an ankle in the drop. larkin felt the panic rising in him. he pulled his scope from its bag, slotted it into place, popped the cap, and was about to take a look when an arm locked around his throat. larkin twisted, but the grip refused to break. his blood thudded in his temples as the choke-hold tightened and pinched his windpipe and carotid arteries. but his throat was shut. there was a popping sound, and illumination flares banged off overhead. the drop area was suddenly, starkly lit. pitch-black shadows, angular and hard, stabbed across him. he saw the knife. larkin gurgled. the roof-lamps began to fizzle on, drenching the wide bay with stale yellow light. hark yelled, turning. a voice floated back from the enemy side. hark said, looking back at the red-faced obel. sir. obel pulled his compass from his fatigues. commissar hark snapped to attention. a tall figure in a long storm coat walked across the bay to join him. he looked for all the world like hark's shadow, drawn out and extended by the bad lights. he was screwing the top back onto a paint stick. he tried to avoid hark's stern look. so� they're not ready. not for this. not for a night drop. he waited for a moment as medics lesp and chayker carried the moaning loglas out of the bay. the rest of obel's detachment were clambering up the scaffolding of the sixteen metre tall drop towers and recoiling the rappelling cables, ready to resume drop positions. yelled gaunt. gasped larkin. the choke-hold relaxed and larkin fell sideways at last, panting for breath. trooper lijah larkin! sergeant obel's voice sang across the bay. larkin looked back at cuu, another surly curse forming in his mouth. but cuu had disappeared. obel was waiting for him at the base of one of the towers. the last few men were clambering up the scaffold, encumbered by full assault kit. a couple had stopped at the foot of the tower to take sponges from a water can and smear away the tell-tale traces of red paint from their fatigues. gutes, garond and unkin, the three point men, were crouching there, dropcables coiled on their laps. one end of each cable was secured to locking damps on the gantry above the plank. feth, yes. you? the last of the lights were going out. down below somewhere, hark was blowing his whistle. three short bursts. unkin called back down the waiting rows. larkin couldn't see the men on the neighbouring towers. he couldn't even see the towers themselves. a hooded flashlight cast a small green glow and showed another man joining them on the tower shelf. it was gaunt. he moved in amongst them. several troopers groaned. chorused the point men in the dark, spilling their lines down expertly from the plank. they were already hooked up. larkin could hear the abrasive buzz of the cables as they went taut and took the weight of the first men. drizzles of low-pulse fire twinkled in the darkness below. larkin stepped up under the arch, holding the tunic tail of the man in front. then the man was gone. larkin pulled his harness tight and went over into space. he swung wildly. the hook bucked and whined as its brake disk clamped at the cable. he could smell nylon burning with the friction. the impact seemed even harder than the last time. the deck smacked the wind out of him. he struggled to release his hook, and rolled clear just before the man after him came hissing down. he was on his belly again, like last time. his shoulder nudged a hard surface as he crawled forward and he moved his back against it. where were the flares? where were the fething flares? his long-las was out of its cover, and the scope in place. someone ran past him and his vox earpiece was busy with man to man signals. larkin sighted. the night scope gave him vision, showed him the world as a green, phantom swirl. the enemy gun flashes were hot little spikes of light that left afterimages on the viewfinder. he saw a figure in cover to his left, down behind some oil drums. said larkin, and his gun fizzled a low-energy charge. man out! obel ordered curtly over the vox-link. larkin looked around. they were in place, facing the right fething way this time. men moved forward. larkin stayed put. he was more use to them static and hunting. he saw bonin stalking two of his team and popped him out of the game too. flash charges went off down to larkin's right. the bay rang. some of obel's squad, along with men from the neighbouring tower, had engaged fullon with the passive team. five or six times. then he heard someone cry out in real pain. the lights came on again, slowly and feebly. mkvenner? the scout looked unhappy. think it was larkin, sir. everyone turned. bragg stumbled out from behind some empty munition boxes, clutching a deep red stain on his shoulder that wasn't paint. cuu cuu wandered back to the passive unit. as he passed larkin, he turned and glared at the sniper with his cold, green eyes. he laid his guard-issue lasrifle on the counter of the munitorium store and brushed the backs of his fingers down the length of it like a showman beginning a trick. varl sighed. kolea was a big man, an ex-miner from verghast, and he towered over his tanith comrade. but it wasn't his size that immediately alarmed the clerk. it was his soft tone and calm eyes. varl had been spiky and aggressively direct, but the newcomer oozed potent wrath held in restraint below the surface. guardsmen, all of them the so-called ghosts, began to troop in, lugging ammo boxes. they started to stack them on the counter until there wasn't any more room. varl cried. warned varl. varl cursed. varl, kolea� get your men back to the billet. round up the other squad leaders and run an inventory. i want to know just how much viable ammunition we've got left. account for all of it. don't let any of the men stash stuff in socks or musette bags. pool it all and we'll distribute it evenly. let's see what we can sort out� he'd been polishing his axerake pin with a hank of vizzy-cloth until it shone. that's what the inspection's for. ready for war, not ready for the parade ground. see? a little camo-paint and spit. or boot-wax. vadim peered more closely at milo's pin. he'd taken a tin of boot-wax out of his kitbag and was beginning to apply it to his pin as milo had suggested. he wasn't much older than milo, perhaps early twenties. he had a strong nose and a generous mouth, and small, dark mischievous eyes. he'd seen vervunhive main spine himself. there were smaller mountains. he glanced around the wide, underlit chart table at his officers. the question came from captain ban daur, the verghastite fourth officer of the tanith regiment. gaunt had brought him along as his aide. corbec and rawne were busy readying the men and daur, gaunt knew, had a cool head for strategy and soaked up tactics like a sponge. van voytz deferred to the person on his immediate left, a short, fidgeting man dressed in the black leather and red braid of the imperial tacticians cadre. his name was biota. daur nodded. gaunt knew what he was thinking. admiral ornoff, the drogue commander, nodded. a small woman with close-cropped black hair, jagdea was the chief officer of the phantine fighter corps. her aviators had been providing protection since the drogues set out, and they would lead the raid in. zhyte, an ill-tempered brute on the other side of the table, nodded. he was the field commander of the seventh urdeshi storm-troop, a regiment of nine thousand men. he wore the black and white puzzle-camo of his unit like he meant it. the urdeshi were the main strength of the imperial war on phantine, if only numerically, and gaunt knew it. numbering little more than three thousand, his ghosts were very much light support. urdesh, the famous forge world, had fallen to the archenemy several years before. gaunt's men had already fought the products of the captured weapon shops and tank factories on hagia. the urdeshi regiments, eight of them, were famously good shock troops, and, like the tanith, were dispossessed. the difference was that the urdeshi still had a home world to win back. even now, the urdeshi sixth, fourth light and tenth were engaged upon the liberation of their world. zhyte's filthy demeanor was probably down to the fact he wished he and his men were all there, instead of here, fighting to free up some stinking vapour mills. still, gaunt wished his men had been given the main assault. van voytz pointed his stick towards the smallest dome. fazalur, next to gaunt, smiled at last. he was a weathered man with shaven hair. he wore the quilted cream tunic of the local army. gaunt was aware of the terrible loyalties being stretched in this force-screened room.  zhyte, longing to be in a war elsewhere, a war that actually mattered to him and his men. daur � and gaunt himself � wishing the ghosts weren't going in so underprepared. fazalur, yearning for his men to have the honour of leading the liberation of his own fething world. but the phantine skyborne numbered less than six hundred. there was an uneasy pause. gaunt knew that at least three men around that table ached to unburden themselves and complain. no one spoke. the drinks after the briefing had been intended to be convivial, to break the ice between commanders who knew little about one another. but it had been stiff and awkward. turning down the lord general's vintage amasec, gaunt had withdrawn early, walking down the hardwood floor of the bridge deck and up a screwstair onto the drogue's forward observation deck. he stood on a metal grille suspended by tension hawsers inside an inverted dome of armoured glass. outside, the endless skies of phantine boiled and frothed. he looked down. there was no land to see. only millions of square kilometres of dimpled, stained cloud. there were fast moving ribbons of pearly sculpture, dotting puffs of yellow fleece, iridescent bars of almost silver gas. murky darkness seeped up through parts of the cloud, unwholesome twists of smog and venting corruption. far below, occasional flares of ignited gas blossomed in the dense, repellent cloud. phantine had been an industrial world for fifteen centuries, and now it was largely inhospitable to human kind. unchecked resource mining and rapacious petrochemical overproduction had ruined the surface and created a lethal blanket of air pollution five kilometres deep. only the highest places remained. spire-like mountains, or the uppermost tips of long-dead hives. these spires and tips protruded from the corrosive gas seas and formed remote islands where mankind might just continue the habitation of the world its greed had killed. places like cirenholm and ouranberg. and the only reason for those precarious habitations was so that mankind could continue to plunder the chemical resources of phantine sliding under the handrail, gaunt sat down on the edge of the walkway so that his boots were dangling. craning out, he could just see back down the vast underbelly of the drogue. the pleated gas sacks. the armoured canvas panels. they glowed ochre in the unhealthy half-sun. he could see one of the huge engine nacelles, its chopping propeller blades taller than a warlord titan. gaunt glanced up. colonel colm corbec hunkered down next to him. the big, thick-bearded man leaned against the handrail. he added, sitting down next to gaunt and letting his legs swing off the grille. gaunt smiled. he plucked a hip flask from his trouser pocket, took a swig, and offered it to gaunt. gaunt shook his head. he'd abstained from alcohol with an almost puritanical conviction since the dark days on hagia several months before. there, he and his ghosts had almost paid the price for lord general lugo's mistakes. cornered and frustrated, and tormented by an over-keen sense of responsibility invested in him by his mentors slaydo and oktar, gaunt had come closer to personal failure than at any time in his career. he'd drunk hard, shamefully, and allowed his men to suffer. only the grace of the emperor, and perhaps of the beati saint sabbat, had saved him. he'd fought back, against the forces of chaos and his own private daemons, and routed the arch-enemy, driving back their forces just hours before hagia could be overrun. hagia had been spared, lugo disgraced, and the ghosts had survived, both as an active unit and as living beings. there was no part of that hard path gaunt wanted to retrace. corbec sighed, took back the flask and sipped again. he missed the old gaunt the commander who would kick back and drink the night away with his men as hard as he'd fight for them the next day. corbec understood gaunt's caution, and had no wish to see his beloved commander turned back into a raging, drunken malcontent. but he missed the comradely gaunt. corbec stared at gaunt, all the laughter gone from his eyes. outside, the sun had come out and the noxious clouds had wafted away from the ports. they looked out and saw the vast shape of the drogue escorting them, a kilometre long dirigible painted silver on the belly and white on the top. it had a ribbed, hardwood frame and extended out at the front in a fluked ram the size of a giant nalwood. they could see the eight motor nacelles along its belly beating the air with their huge props. beyond it, in the suddenly gleaming light, they could see the next drogue in formation. control, halo leader. the word is evangeline. viltry's sensors showed the first hard returns of the cirenholm promontory. viltry noted with satisfaction the ten green lights that flashed live on his munition screen. serrikin, his payload officer, had done his job perfectly. another patch of turbulence. harder. the cabin shook. viltry kept glancing at the locator. halo two, halo leader. west quadrant. viltry threw the release switches. his marauder rose with a lurch as it loosed the weight. he nursed it back. halo flight banked away west, turning and reforming for the run back to the drogue. behind them, colossal clouds of feathery nickel filaments bloomed out in the air, blinding the already half-blind sensors of cirenholm. the muster-deck of the nimbus, lit a cold, merciless white, was thronging with ghosts. they were arranged by squad in rows marked by pew-like benches. it was twenty-one twenty-five hours. ibram gaunt entered the muster hall and walked down the rows, chatting and exchanging pleasantries with the men. he was dressed for the drop in a hip-length, fur collared leather jacket, his cap still on. his bolt pistol was bolstered under his left armpit in a buckled rig, and his power sword, the trophy weapon of house sondar, was webbed across his back. he already wore his drop-harness, the heavy arrester hook banging against his thigh. the tanith seemed ready. they looked fine. no one had the nervous look gaunt always watched for.  each ghost was prepping up, and then turning to let his neighbour in the squad double-check his harness and couplings. they were all buttoned up and beginning to sweat. lasguns were cinched tight across their chests. gloves were going on. each trooper had a balaclava and a rubberised gashood ready to pull on, his beret tucked away. camo-cloaks were rolled like bedding into a tight tube across the backside. gaunt saw obel checking bragg down. gaunt indicated the autocannon and tripod that bragg was to carry down the rope. support weapon troopers and voxofficers would have the hardest time tonight. caill was bragg's ammo-humper. he had drum magazines strung over both shoulders. he made his way over, passing doc dorden and surgeon ana curth, who were inoculating every trooper in turn with altitude sickness shots � acetazolamide, their systems more than used to it since the holy depths of hagia � together with counter-toxin boosters and an anti airsickness drug. any shirkers? a few. stand easy. i'm sure i'm just repeating what mkoll has told you, but i have a gut feeling this will be down to you. the lord general, and the other regimental commanders, are looking at this like a nut to crack by force. wrong. i think it's going to take smarts. this is city fighting. cirenholm may be stuck up on a fething mountain, but it's a city nevertheless. you've got to kill clever. lead us in. make the place ours. the lord general refused the idea of giving anyone under command rank the city plans, but i'm breaking that. gaunt paused. he looked round, took them eye by eye. they returned his look. gaunt smiled down at the short, thick-set man. soric wore an eye-patch and disdained augmetic work. he had been an ore-smeltery boss on verghast, and then a scratch squad leader. soric had courage enough for an entire company of men. gaunt turned. ayatani zweil, wizened and white-bearded, hopped out beside him, and put his hands either side of gaunt's face. gaunt smiled. the regiment had acquired ayatani zweil on hagia, and he had become their chaplain. he was imhava ayatani, a roving priest dedicated to saint sabbat, in whose name and memory this entire crusade was being fought. gaunt didn't really understand what made the old, white-bearded priest tick, but he valued his company. the old, ragged priest's voice suddenly dipped and became stilled. control, umbra leader viltry waited. viltry paused. he glanced down at gammil, and his navigator checked the scanner carefully before shaking his head. halo three's gone! halo three's gone! he ordered. the world turned upside down and viltry was pressed back into his grav-seat by the force of the spinning dive. he saw the dying fireball that had been halo three streaming away in the headwind in bands of blue flame. his control console lit up and alarms blared. viltry realised he was target locked. he cursed and flipped the marauder over, hearing gammil squeal in pain as he was thrown headlong out of the navigator seat. they were tumbling. the altimeter was spinning like a speeded up chronometer. they were dropping fast, almost beyond the point of recovery. viltry hauled on the squad and fired the burners, slamming the marauder back up and out of its evasive plummet. he tore off his breather mask and vomited as the extreme g forces pumped his guts empty. his pounding ears suddenly became aware of a screaming on the vox-link. halo four. halo leader to control! halo leader to control! enemy raiders in the dispersal field! the target lock alarm sang out again. halo leader slammed forward so hard viltry bit through his own lips. he saw his blood spiralling away and spattering against the canopy as the stricken marauder went into a lengthways spin. he could smell burning cabling and a cold, hard stink of high altitude air. he leaned into the controls and levelled the warcraft out. one of his engines was on fire. over the vox, he could hear his aft gunner wailing. he turned to look down at gammil. the navigator was crawling back to his seat. viltry barked. viltry's hands were slick with sweat inside his gloves. white hot cannon shells sliced down through the cabin, mincing the navigator and his station in a welter of steel splinters, blood and smoke. the entire lower fuselage of halo leader sheared off, shredding into the freezing night. viltry saw serrikin tumbling away in a cloud of debris, dropping into the corrosive darkness far below. the freezing air howled around him. he reached for his ejector lever. the canopy exploded. two ana curth washed her hands under the infirmary's chrome faucet for the third time in fifteen minutes and then dusted them with sterilising talc. she was fidgety, restless. the infirmary hall was a quiet vault, well-lit and ranged with rows of freshly laundered beds. curth checked a few drug bottles on the dispensary cart, then sighed and walked down the length of the bay. her boots rang out cold, empty beats and her red surgical gown billowed out behind her like a lord palatine's cape. the tanith chief medic was lying serenely on his back on one of the beds, staring at the ceiling. curth hesitatingly laid herself out on the bed next to dorden. she stared at the ceiling, her heels together, her arms by her side. now she'd have to wash her hands again. twenty-three six imperial. not a bad delay. ninety seconds! umbra leader to umbra flight. let's nose ahead for one last burn. chase the urdeshi formations. i've got a sick feeling there's opposition aloft tonight. the amber rune had not yet come on. kolea strapped on his gas-hood, and went down the line checking his ghosts, one by one. the side hatch of drop 2d was already open. trooper garond shivered in the slip-stream blast, and made ready with the rope as sergeant obel gave the signal. outside, he could see cloud whipping past and several drop-ships lying abeam, men crouched in their open hatches, ready and prepped. aboard drop 2b, colm corbec fitted his gas-hood and ordered the hatches open. the squads took their positions, on their feet. mkoll was at the head of the second squad, ready to lead the scout fireteam in. corbec nodded to him and uttered a final prayer. in drop 2k, sergeant ewler looked over at sergeant adare. viltry woke again and found his face and shoulder were beginning to burn with the cold. he didn't want to die like this. not alone, discarded, like a wind-blown seed. his numb fingers closed around the toggle.  he snatched his hand away and cursed his selfishness. unless� if dispersal command-control heard his distress beacon, they'd know that something had happened to halo flight. they'd realise there were hunters loose. he'd be warning them. filled with a sense of duty, viltry pulled the toggle. it came away in his hand. shrapnel had ripped away the beacon's trigger switch. suddenly, there was a creamy glow below them. available light was reflecting off the primary dome of cirenholm in frosty midnight shine. the drop-ship's braking jets wailed so loud zhyte could hear them through his hood. they were stationary, as stationary as the headwind allowed, right over the drop zone. zhyte prayed they were low enough. zhyte growled. there was a bright flash outside. then another. he screamed into his link. another urdeshi drop-ship suddenly became visible in the night as it caught fire and burned down like a comet. a moment later, cirenholm's defences woke up and lit the air with a ferocious cross-stitching of tracer fire. shells whacked into drop 1a's fuselage next to shener. he had been coiling out the rope. a terrible, exposed cold filled his legs and lower torso and he looked down to see that there was an extraordinarily large, bloody hole in his gut. shener toppled out of the hatch wordlessly and fell away into the gloom below. zhyte reached the hatchway, battered by the wind. shener was gone, and the two men first up the squad had been exploded across the bay. there were punctures in the hull. outside, a storm of enemy fire bloomed up at them. zhyte clipped his arrestor hook to the rope. he leapt into space. drop 1c rocked as its neighbour exploded. whinnying scraps of outflung debris punched through the drop's hull. sergeant gwill and three other troopers were killed instantly. corporal gader, half-blinded in his hood, suddenly realised he was in charge. the green rune was on. he ordered the men out. two thirds of the squads had exited when cannon shells ripped drop 1c open. gader was thrown out of the hatch. he gestured tragically with his arrestor hook as he fell. but there was no rope. gader dropped like a stone, right down the face of cirenholm's primary dome, bouncing once off an aerial strut. drop 1k misjudged the headwind and came in too low, mashing against the side of the dome in a seething blister of fire. just behind it drop 1n braked backwards in a flurry of jets and then trembled as a rain of cannon shells peeled off its belly, spilling men out into the darkness. drop 1m faltered, and tried to gain height. its men were already deploying out of the hatches. sliding down the ropes, they discovered that the drop was not only too high, it was also fifty metres short of the dz. each man in turn came off the end of the dangling rope and fell away into the void. the pilot of drop 1d saw the enemy cloud-fighter with perfect clarity as it powered in, weapons flickering. he had no room to either pull up or bank. his troops were already on the ropes and heading down. drop 1d exploded under the withering fire of the passing interceptor. singis, his young, cadet-school trained subaltern, ran past, trying to get the men up. zhyte saw a two-man stub-team attempting to erect their weapon, hampered by the men who were dropping all around them and sometimes on top of them. indeed, there were so many men coming down now that the immediate dz was filling up. penned in by the city wall, the edge of the balustrade and the defending gunfire, they were rapidly filling up every precious metre of the drop area. deployed troopers were being knocked down by the wave behind them.  one man was pushed out over the balustrade, and was only just clawed back by his desperate comrades. zhyte could feel the powerful downwash of the drop-ships as they came in overhead, jostling for position. the urdeshi commander could see for about a kilometre along the length of the curving promenade. all the way along, drop-ships were clustering and roping out the strings of his puzzle-camoed troops. he saw a firefight around a hatchway fifty metres away as his fifth platoon tried to storm entry. he saw the flash of four grenades. he saw a drop-ship pummelled by tube-shot rockets, saw it burn as it tilted sideways, tearing through the drop-ropes of two other ships, cascading men to their deaths. as he watched, it exploded internally and fell, glancing off the promenade with enough force to shake the deck under his feet. a fireball now, it pitched sideways and fell off the city shelf into the abyss. a trooper to zhyte's left had lost his gas-hood in the descent. he was choking and frothing, yellow blisters breaking the skin around his lips and eyes. zhyte ran forward, ignoring the las-rounds exploding around him. he got into cover behind a low wall with four of his squad's troopers. he rasped, indicating the elevated walkway with a gloved hand. the man immediately right of him was suddenly hit twice and went tumbling back. a second defence position had opened up, raking 50-cal auto-cannon fire into the unprotected throng of the landing troops. they were dying. dying so fast, zhyte couldn't believe what he was seeing. they were packed in like cattle, without cover, with nowhere to move to. with a curse that came from somewhere deep in his guts, zhyte ran into the open towards the walkway. tracer fire stippled the ground at his feet. he hurled a grenade and the back blast knocked him down. two men grabbed him and dragged him into cover. the walkway was on fire and sagging. urdeshi troops poured forward from the dense, corralled mob at the dz. zhyte never did find out who it was. ibram gaunt was the first man out, the first onto the ropes. the secondary dome of cirenholm lay below. a huge fog of light and fire throbbed in the night sky behind the silhouetted curve of the more massive primary dome. the urdeshi assault had been met with huge force. gaunt hit the dz clean, and ran clear of the rope end as his men came down. las-fire was beginning to spit down at them from gun positions higher up the dome slope. the tanith were landing, as per instructions, on a wide balcony that ran entirely around the widest part of the dome's waist. over the vox came a curt report announcing that both corbec and mkoll's squads were on the balcony too, about a hundred metres away. troopers caober and wersun were right behind gaunt. he waved them wide to the right, to set up covering fire. he could see sergeant burone's drop-ship lining up ahead, hatches open as it came in over the balcony. the message buzzed over the vox. it was sergeant varl, somewhere behind him. a lattice of laser fire lit up the night maybe two hundred metres east, flickering along the balcony. gaunt saw figures ahead of him, armed men rushing out onto the balcony shelf. they were shadows, but he knew they weren't his own. varl's squad had come down into the middle of a firefight. kolea's unit was dropping to their right, and obel's somewhere behind. varl scurried forward, popping off random shots with his rifle. the enemy was secured around one of the major hatchways leading off the balcony walk into the dome. they were in behind flakboard and sandbags. the tanith edged forward, using ornamental planters and windscreens as cover, pumping fire at the entrance. varl saw ifvan and jajjo scrambling up onto a walkway and running to get good shooting positions. he ducked in behind a potted fern that had long since been eaten away by acid rain, and fired a sustained burst at a section of flakboard. five other troopers, also in cover, joined him and the emphatic fire they laid up between them smashed the blast fence down. varl voxed. a dozen men were shot off the ropes before they'd even reached the deck. drop 2p had its belly shot out by ground fire and limped away, dragging streamers of men behind it. there were enemy forces out on the balcony itself, firing up at the troop ships as they came over. and there were at least four multi-barrel autocannon nests firing out of windows further up the dome's surface. rawne said, turning back inside. feygor moved down the waiting squad with an open musette bag, getting every man to toss in one of his tube charges. rawne growled back into the vox. the voice on the vox complained. don't make me come up front and make your heart bleed too, you craven sack of crap. domor cried, and then clambered over the backs of several sprawled men to reach the port hatch. milo and bonin had just succeeded in dragging nehn back inside. domor looked out. their drop, spewing sheets of flame from somewhere near the ventral line, was limping slowly forward up over the patched, greasy roof plates of the secondary dome itself. they were already a good three hundred metres past the dz. looking back, domor saw the waves of tanith ships coming in, roping out into a spasming fuzz of light. domor's vox-set was awash with radio traffic from the assaulting forces. he recognised voices, coded deployments, call-signs. but it all sounded like it was coming from men who were fading away into a distance, like a party he was leaving too soon. the curve of the dome was chopping the transmissions. they had missed. they'd had their chance and they'd fethed it. there was no going back, no reversing back through the deploying lines. they were overshooting up and across the target city-dome itself. under such circumstances, standing orders applied and they were clear: abort and pull out along 1:03:04 magnetic, and return to the base drogue. that's it, boys. nice try, but no thanks. go home and better luck next time. but abort wasn't an option. domor craned out. they'd clearly damaged a fuel-line, and that was on fire. and from the sway of the old, heavy drop, the pilot had lost a good proportion of his attitude control. they'd never make it back to the drogue. not in a million years. even if there was a chance, and domor was fething sure there wasn't, a pull-out at this height and crawl rate would glide them right over the dome's lip-guns as a nice, slow, fat, fire-marked target. they were dead. varl ducked. chunks of stone and scabs of plasteel spattered from the archway above his head. down the hall, someone was the proud owner of a heavy autocannon. they'd broken the rim defence and forced access into one of the main hatches leading off the secondary dome's balcony. his squad was the first one inside, though from the sound of the vox-traffic, rawne was making headway further around the dome edge. the hatch they'd fought their way in through gave onto a wide lobby dressed with polished ashlar and set with angular, cosmetic pillars. the floor was littered with brick chips and dust, and the bodies of the enemy dead. varl knew he was facing the troops of the notorious blood pact. he'd paid special attention in the briefings. the blood pact weren't enflamed zealots. they were professional military, soldiers sworn to the badges of chaos. he could tell from the tight, well-orchestrated resistance alone that he was dealing with trained warriors. they were holding the lobby with textbook authority: light support weapons blocking the main throughway, peppering the hatch opening with measured, tight bursts. varl ran to the next pillar, and watched in dismay as gunfire chewed away a good chunk of its stone facing. stone splinters sprayed from the damage. he voxed. the flamer had got them through the opening. if they could move brostin further forward into the lobby's throat, they might take the next mark. las-fire and solid rounds spat past him. varl could see brostin in cover three pillars away. varl peered out and took a hit to his shoulder that toppled him back. he writhed back into cover, patting out the smouldering hole in his uniform. his augmetic shoulder, heavy and metallic, had absorbed the shot. damn these gas-hoods! crouching around, varl could see the big verghastite, ducked down behind a pillar on the right, with two other men from his squad. cannonfire pounded down the hallway, filling the air with dust and flying chips. despite his hood, varl could hear the clinking rain of spent cases the enemy gun was spilling out onto the marble deck. varl slid round onto his knees and started to prep a tube charge. there was a sudden increase in resistance fire, and the flooring between the pillar rows was speckled with the ugly mini-craters of heavy fire. varl looked up and saw, to his disbelief, that kolea had successfully run forward into the maw of the enemy, and was now two pillars ahead of him on the other side. kolea stood with his back to the chipped, punished pillar and lobbed a grenade out over his shoulder. the blast welled flame down towards them. varl sprang up and ran through the smoke, dropping down behind a pillar ahead of kolea. seeing him, kolea swung out and drew level, then moved one ahead. it was like some stupid fething competition, like the brainless games of devil-dare varl had played as a teenager. there was no skill in this. no tactics, no battle-smarts. it was just sheer balls. running into gunfire, damning the bullets, shaming the devil and taunting him. they were edging ahead simply by dint of bravado, simply through luck that neither of them had been hit. kolea looked back at varl. devil-dare. bullet, whickered all around. varl ran out, sidestepped a tight burst and then pushed his already threadthin luck further in order to dive behind the next pillar up. he could feel it vibrate against his back as cannonfire punched into the far side. devil-dare. devil-fething-dare. but enough was enough. the emperor, may he be ever vigilant, had smiled on them this far, but that was it. another step would be suicide. varl knew luck was a soldier's friend. it'd suck by you, but it was fickle, and it hated being asked for favours. there were a good few from both backgrounds who manifested the uglier resentments, prejudices or simple racial enmities that made up the worst. sergeant varl and sergeant kolea had been friends from an early stage, but their friendship was catalysed in rivalry. each was a notable soldier, popular with the men. each enjoyed a good relationship with gaunt. and each was in charge of a section that was considered by all to be fine, solid and second-string. there was nothing formal about the distinction. it was just a given that a handful of platoons formed the regimental elite: mkoll's scouts, rawne's merciless band, corbec's dedicated unit, bray's tightly-drilled, tightlydisciplined squad and the determined, courageous mob schooled by soric. kolea and varl both yearned to elevate their own squads into that illustrious upper echelon. it was all fine and dandy to be regarded as part of the solid, dependable backbone. but it wasn't enough for either of them. in combat, that competition came out. it didn't help that both had missed the epic battle for the shrinehold on hagia.  they had formed the rearguard then, and done a fine job, but they had not been there to share the glory of the big fight. to prove their worth. and so now it came down to devil-dare. stupid, dumb-ass devil-dare games, urging fate and luck and all the other monsters of the cosmic firmament to make one a hero-winner and the other a loser-corpse. varl had come up from the ranks. he had fought for his stripes, and not just been given them due to his record as a scratch-company hero like kolea. but enough was enough. i'm going ahead varl looked out from cover, and saw a fountain spray of las-fire and tracers vomit down the hallway. he saw kolea running forward, somehow, impossibly, alive in the midst of it. he saw thousands of individual impacts as soot and dust and mortar was smashed out of the bullet-holes in the floor, the roof and the walls. kolea ran on. he'd lost his wife at vervunhive and, he had believed, his children too. some cruel twitch of fate had allowed them to survive and to end up in the care of the female trooper tona criid and her devoted tanith partner caffran. cruel wasn't the word. it was too cruel. it was beyond cruel. he'd only discovered the fact on hagia, and pain had sealed his mouth. those kids � dalin and yoncy � had been through so much, believing their parents lost and gaining fine new ones in the form of criid and caffran, kolea had decided never to disturb their world again. he had avoided them. he had stayed away. no one had ever found out the truth, except for surgeon curth, in whom he had confided. it was better that way. it freed him. freed him to fight and die and serve the emperor. kolea ran on into a rain of fire. he was a big man who had served a long time in the mines of verghast. grim, largely humourless, powerful. he should have formed a huge target, but somehow the enemy fire missed him. shots ripped the air around him, cast sparks from the pillars, blew stone chips from the floor. he lived. he thought about diving for cover, but he was so nearly there it didn't seem to matter. kolea came on the enemy position from the side, leapt over the horseshoe of sandbags and shot the two cannon gunners down. a third lunged at him from the left and kolea's bayonet tip punched through his forehead with a crack. these brutes were blood pact. they wore old but well maintained suits of armour-plated canvas dyed a dark red, drapes of ammo-belts and munition pouches secured on black nylon webbing, and crimson steel bowl helmets with sneering, hook-nosed blast-visors. chaos insignia glinted on their sleeves and chests. more blood pact troops rushed out at kolea, assuming they had been stormed by force. their red-tunicked forms twisted away as varl ran forward, firing his lasgun on auto, yelling the names of his sisters, his father, his mother and his homestead farm. raflon, nour and brostin were right behind him. ration made a stupendously good shot that burst the skull of a blood pact trooper who was turning out of cover from behind a doorpost. then brostin washed the hallway beyond with a bright belch of promethium flame. something exploded. two blood pact troopers staggered into the main hall, their red uniforms ablaze, the armour plating falling out of the burning canvas of their sleeves. wordlessly, varl and kolea heaved the enemy autocannon around on its tripod and blitzed down into the corridor beyond: varl firing, his hands clamped to the yoke, kolea feeding the belts from the use-bruised panniers. the big old cannon had huge power. varl knew that. a minute before he'd been running into it. heavy support fire blasted from their left. kolea barked. nour and bragg, caill, raflon, hwlan, brostin and brehenden, vril and mkvan, a dozen more, ran past them into the inner hall, covering and firing. varl threw the emptied cannon aside and looked at kolea. milo cut in. said domor. haller was at one hatch, bonin and nehn at the other. the burning drop was wallowing over the dome, in darkness now, the curve of the dome eclipsing the flare of the main fight. they couldn't see a thing. they might as well be over the edge of the dome for all they could tell. the night was awash of black with no solid edges. it seemed to commander bree jagdea that the fight was happening a long way away, on another planet. flares and flashes lit up the night sky to her right, but they were a long, long way away. she lay on the curved metal surface of one of cirenholm's habitat domes, the secondary one she guessed. it was cold and the crossing night wind bit deep. her arm and several ribs were broken from the ejected landing. her flight suit was torn. her blimp-chute had barely had time to deploy as she had fired up out of the seat of her dead fighter. smack, the dome had come up to meet her hard. and here, she presumed, she would stay until the midnight frosts made her a brittle part of the dome roof decoration. when jagdea saw the drop-ship, it was already on fire and coming in low over the dome towards her, spitting debris and flame, crawling crippled from the main fight. she saw the hatches were open, saw figures in the hatches. men about to rope out. they were going long. they were going long, off the edge of the dome, into the scald. she didn't think. bonin yelped. domor voxed the pilot. drop 2k yawed left, up and over the side of the secondary dome, a dark hemisphere below it. there was a splash of almost fluorescent light on the surface of the dome, a fizzle of flare just now beginning to sputter away. the men roped out. milo led the squad out of the port, his hook whizzing down the cable until he slammed into the curving roof and tumbled off. domor was behind him, then bonin, then ezlan. on the starboard side, haller came out, followed by vadim, reggo and nirriam. the men thumped down onto the roof, scrabbling for handholds, desperate not to slide off into the night.  twenty men down, twenty-five. thirty. thirtyfive. the drop's engines failed. clinging to the curve of the roofing panels on his belly, domor heard the pilot scream. he looked back. the drop-ship simply fell out of the air and smashed into the roof, crashing a half-dozen of the roping men under it. then it began to slide. three an awful creaking, screeching sound filled the air, metal on metal. there were still at least twenty men attached to the ropes, their arrestor hook locks biting the loose cables because of the sudden slackening. the men were tangled, and being dragged. domor, nehn and milo struggled up and watched the blazing drop slowly sliding and shrieking away down the curve of the dome, hauling guardsmen after it. the pilot was still screaming. domor yelled. bonin cut the rope with his tanith blade and fell free. he rolled, and managed to seize hold of an icy roof strut. eight of haller's men sawed their way clear of the snarling ropes too. ezlan lost his knife, but managed to writhe himself out of his webbing. the moment his blade severed it, the drop rope came whipping out of dremmond's arrestor hook because it was under too much tension. the blow left him sprawled on the roof with a long, deep slash from the hawser across his collar. six more of haller's men and nine more of domor's managed to cut themselves free of the straining rope? and ding onto the roofing panels. then the drop went off over the side of the dome under its own massive weight, jerking threads of shrieking men after it. silence. milo got to his feet, unsteady. it was suddenly very dark and cold. the raked roof underfoot was slick with frost. the only light came from the burning tatters of debris outflung across the steeper pitches of the dome, and the sky glow of the battle they had become detached from. despite the figures struggling up around him, he felt monstrously alone. domor stammered over the vox. one by one, out of order, the survivors reeled off their call-signs. fifteen of domor's squad had survived. haller had fourteen. the soldiers began to congregate on a flat decking area behind a vox-mast that protruded from the dome like a corroded thorn. everyone was unsteady on their feet and there were some heart stopping slips. ezlan and bonin joined the group, carrying an injured female aviator between them. her name was jagdea. her lightning had been brought down and she'd ejected onto the roof. she'd been the one who'd popped the flare and guided them in. her arm was broken and she was slipping into shock, so she barely heard the mumbled gratitude of the guardsmen. milo glanced round sharply as he heard a thump. dremmond, wounded and weighed down by his flamer, had risen only to lose his feet on the ice. he burbled. milo moved. dremmond had already slid right past two troopers either too stunned to move or too aware of their own tenuous footing. dremmond's dangling arrestor hook and promethium tanks were squealing over the roof metal. milo slithered down towards him. he heard several voices yell at him. his feet went out and he landed on his backside, sliding down himself now. unable to stop, he banged into dremmond, who clutched at him, and they slid together. faster. faster. the lip of the roof looked hideously close. milo could see the burnt score marks where the weight of the drop-ship had gone over just moments before. they jerked to a halt. breathing hard, milo realised his las-gun strap had fouled a rusty rivet standing proud of the plating. dremmond clung to him. the canvas strap began to stretch and fray. something heavy bounced down the frosty roof beside them. milo heard a voice call from above. he got his hands around it. looking up, he saw a trooper edging hand over hand down the rope towards them. it was the verghastite, vadim. a huddle of shadows further up the slope showed where bonin, haller, domor and several of the others were anchoring the other end of the rope under the vox-mast. vadim urged from below. it seemed to take an age. milo felt numb. then hands were reaching for him and dragging him and dremmond up amongst the cluster of bodies around the mast where the rope was tied off. when he looked back down at vadim, milo was astonished to see he wasn't alone. he was dragging two more figures with him. milo immediately added his own strength to the steady, regular heaves. vadim had found seena and arilla, the two verghastite women from haller's squad who crewed the autocannon. they'd been dragged off the dome by the drop-ship, but their section of rope had parted and snagged around a vent under the lip. they'd been left hanging in space. vadim had heard their desperate calls on his way down to milo and dremmond. the ghosts pulled the trio to comparative safety. vadim lay flat for a moment, exhausted. fayner, the one surviving field medic, checked the girls over and then packed dremmond's ugly wound, the exposed areas of which were beginning to blister. the ghosts began to light lamp packs and check over their weapons and equipment. haller and domor were consulting pocket compass and viewers, looking up the massive swell of the dome. domor called bonin over. he was one of the best scouts in the regiment, one of mkoll's chosen. bonin heard him and looked round. he held up a flimsy fold of paper. zhyte nodded but he didn't honestly give a little pebble crap for that idea. if the blood pact had wanted to hold them off, they'd been in a position to do it from the beginning. the urdeshi had managed a few tricks, forced a few advantages, but it was nothing much. the enemy defence had been superb, and viable. it made no sense for them to have abandoned it for better positions. singis was talking out of his arse. zhyte tossed the slate back to his adjutant. though it hurt his pride to think it, this had been a disaster all round. his entire force might by now be impact-splats down in the scald levels if it hadn't been for the phantine lightnings that had driven the enemy nightfighters off. not that he'd ever admit it to that sour bitch aviator jagdea. thanks to the air support, he'd got a good proportion of his men down. he'd lost hundreds rather than thousands. and now this. like his storm-troops were being toyed with. take groups three and four. six and two advance with me. first port of call is that main hatch there. zhyte looked at his wrist-chrono. the beater hand was ticking towards the static marker needle he'd punched and set while giving belthini and rhintlemann the order mark. in a side hall off the main access to the secondary dome, gun smoke drifting in the cool air, trooper wersun was loading his last clip. gaunt huddled down next to him and slid a fresh sickle pattern magazine for his bolt pistol out of his ammo web. he'd sheathed his power sword for the moment. as far as gaunt knew, most of his men were now, like wersun, down to their last. if he ever got out of this, he'd use the power blade of heironymo sondar to put on a novelty ventriloquist show for the ghosts, using the munitorium chief at hessenville as the screaming puppet. gaunt's blood was up. this should have been easier. the blood pact were damn good. gaunt sat back against a block of bullet-chipped masonry. where indeed? he was overheating in the hood now, and sweat was dribbling down his spine. beltayn, his vox-man, was nearby. beltayn wound a small cable from his heavy, high-gain vox-pack and pushed the jack into a socket on the side of gaunt's hood. gaunt's headset micro-bead now had the added power of beltayn's unit. his force was advancing slowly down the access halls parallel to gaunt's. we're at the mouth of an access tunnel. five zero five if you've got your map handy. kolea, varl and obel responded almost simultaneously. varl said urgently. movement, four o'clock whispered banda, cocking her head at rawne. through the lenses of her gas-hood, rawne could see a smile in her eyes. feth! i'm doing it again! rawne cursed himself. maybe it wasn't them. he asked. wheln hissed over the vox. rawne saw them for a brief moment. four, maybe five enemy troopers in muddy red, moving hurriedly down the walkway on the far right hand edge of the park. wheln's lasrifle cracked, and caffran and criid quickly opened up too. one of the figures buckled and dropped and las-shots splintered against the wall of the park. two of the others turned and started to fire into the park. rawne saw their iron-masked faces, sneering above the flashing muzzles of their weapons. there was a loud report from his right. one of the firing enemy was thrown back against the wall as if he'd been struck by a wrecking ball. a flurry of fire whipped back and forth through the park edge now. there must have been more than five of them, rawne decided. he couldn't see. he ran forward, dodging between tree trunks. a sapling just behind him ruptured at head height and swished back and forth from the recoil like a metronome arm. caffran responded. rawne ordered. from behind the statue's plinth, caffran glanced around. whatever faults you could lay at major rawne's door � and heartlessness, lack of humour, deceit and cruelty would be amongst them � he was a damn fine troop leader. here, with no view of his own, he was devolving command to caffran without hesitation, allowing the young private to order the deployment. rawne trusted caffran. he trusted them all. wheln! criid! tight and right. hit the door. leclan! osket! melwid! concentrate on those bushes! neskon, up and forward! banda! the stub fire ceased. if she hadn't actually killed him, banda had certainly discouraged the bastard. whooped melwid meanwhile. criid fired from behind the bench until a trio of close shots splintered the seat-back. she got down onto her belly in time to see two of the enemy running from the doorway towards another dump of bushes near the end of the path. she flicked her toggle to full-auto and raked them from her prone position. one of them dropped a stick grenade he had been about to toss, and the blast threw fine grit and dry dumps of dirt into the park. rawne had moved in close now, into the stands of dead trees by the edge of the fighting. leyr was nearby. with a coughing rush, flames spewed out across the line of bushes as neskon finally got range. leyr shouted. rawne turned, and caught a glimpse of two red-tunicked figures sprinting from the path into the trees, moving past them into the park. ledan was the platoon's corpsman, one of the troopers trained in the rudiments of field aid by dorden and curth. but i think it's superficial. rawne got up and tucked his gas-hood away in his belt. he'd had enough of it anyway. he went over to the corpse and pulled out his knife, twisting the grip to break the suction and free the blade. feygor was moving the platoon up. the fight on the path was over. he walked down to the path. criid, wheln, neskon and melwid were examining the bodies. it was some kind of equipment box, scorched with soot and burned out. the platoon had tensed at movement from the south door, but it was more ghosts. asked daur. he smiled at rawne. come and take a look at this. hark nodded slyly over at banda and criid. now it was hark's turn to joke at rawne's expense, but somehow it didn't matter. rawne would have floored daur for a quip like that. hark crouched down and looked at the half-melted box. hark drew his blade. it was a standard issue, broad-bladed dress dagger, a pugio with a gold aquila crest. he was the only man in the regiment who didn't have a silver tanith warknife. smug know-all bastard, rawne thought. caffran called down the pathway. he was with feygar's fireteam at the end hatch. they hurried down to join him. meryn and daur deployed their troops out across the park to cover all the access points. the hatch was open and its arch was dim. beyond it, rawne could see a corridor with a grilled floor leading deeper into the dome structure. feygor had notoriously sharp eyes. he had been able to spot a larisel at night at a hundred metres back home in the great west nals. and kill it with a dirty look. feygor should have been in the scout section, but rawne had worked determinedly not to lose his lean, murderous ally to mkoll's bunch. a quick vox-check confirmed that all the accessways off the north side of the park showed similar signs of tampering. daur called criid over. pray to the golden throne� daur asked sourly. free of the damn gas-hood at last, gaunt set his cap on his head, brim first he glanced at his watch, took a sip of water from his flask, and looked down the hallway. two storeys high, it was ornate with gilt and floral work, and the floor was a checkerboard of red and white plasteel tiles. crystal chandeliers hung every ten metres, blazing out twinkly yellow light that shone from the huge wall mirrors. gaunt glanced back. his platoon was in cover down the length of the hall, using the architraves and pillars for shelter. wersun and arcuda were guarding a side door which led into a section of staterooms that had already been swept. there was a scent in the air. fading perfume. cirenholm had been a rich place once, before gaur's blood pact had overrun it. here in the palatial halls of the secondary dome, the elegance lingered, melancholy and cold. caober reappeared, coming back down the hall, hugging the shadows. he dropped down next to gaunt. caober nodded. gaunt looked at his chart, and ran a finger around a line that connected the sites his men had reported as covered by shields. they'd all found them: corbec burone, bray, soric. sergeant theiss' squad had actually passed one, and then fallen back rapidly once gaunt had alerted them. only the spearhead formed by obel, kolea and varl had gone beyond, too far beyond to call back now. gaunt smiled at the vox-officer's use of his favourite understatement. he looked at the chart again. his company � with the exception of the spearhead � had penetrated about two-thirds of a kilometre into the dome and had all come up against prepared shield emplacements, no matter what level they were on. soric's mob were six levels lower thanks to a firefight and the chance discovery of a cargo lift. it was as if the enemy had given up the outer rim of the dome to lure them in against this trap. but what kind of trap? was it meant to stop them dead? cut their force in half? pull them on and trap them without hope of retreat? 1a, 3a� this is 2a. respond. �a� repeat this is 3a. his unit was now a kilometre into cirenholm's primary dome, exploring the marble vaults and suspiciously derelict chambers of the sky-city's commercial district. ten minutes before, he had linked up with belthini's group, and together they'd begun sectioning the outer dome. there was still no sign of the enemy. no sign of anyone, in fact, apart from his own puzzlecamoed troops. his skin was starting to crawl. zhyte spat and snatched the mic, cuffing gerrishon for good measure. secondary dome is wired for shields and tertiary may be too. watch for them. slaith, emperor rot him, is no fool, and neither are the blood pact. they're planning something, and� you were only born yesterday and you're nothing! nothing! there's only a bloody handful of you anyway! don't you dare presume to tell me my business, you piece of shit! warning me? warning me? we are taking this bastard city piece by piece, hall by hall, with our blood and our sweat, and the last thing i want to hear is you whining about something that's making you soil your britches because you're too scared to do a soldier's job and get on with it! you hear me, gaunt? gaunt? zhyte cursed and threw the mic back at his vox-officer. the handset hit gerrishon in the face and he fell down suddenly. zhyte paused abruptly. there was a widening pool of blood spreading out across the floor under gerrishon's head. the vox-man's face was tranquil, as if he was sleeping. but there was a blackened hole in his forehead. zhyte howled and turned. a las-round hit him in the shoulder and slammed him to the floor. everything, every last damn bloody thing, was exploding around him. he could hear screams and weapons fire. laser shots spluttered along the walls, shattering ancient holo-plate portraits out of their frames. zhyte crawled round. he saw three of his advance guard topple as they ran. mists of blood sprayed out of them. one was hit so hard his left leg burst and came spinning off. his men were firing. some were screaming. all were yelling. a grenade went off.  zhyte got up and ran back down the hallway, firing his weapon behind him. he ducked behind a pillar and looked back to see blood pact troopers spilling into the hall from all sides. three four two. there was a gun nest there. support fire. he turned and fell over a corpse. it was kadekadenz, his recon man. a blow to the shoulder slammed him over. zhyte rolled, and saw the iron mask of a blood pact trooper grinning at him as he plunged his bayonet down. the rusty blade stabbed through the flesh of zhyte's thigh and made him shriek. he fired twice and blew the chaos soldier off him, then tore the blade from his leg. blood was squirting from a major artery. zhyte got up, and then fell over, his boots slipping in his own blood. he grasped the blood pact soldier's fallen rifle, the smeared bayonet still attached, and rolled over, firing. he hit one, then another, then a third, swiping each one off his feet with the satisfying punch of a solid las-hit. singis grabbed him and began to half-drag, half-carry him back towards the hatch. there were corpses all around. down the hall, zhyte could see nothing but a mob of charging blood pact troopers, chanting and howling as they came on, firing, guns at belly height. he saw his men, littering the marble floor of the hallway. zofer, on his back, jawless. vocane, doubled-up and hugging the belly wound that had killed him. reyuri, his legs in tatters, groping at the air. gofforallo, just upper body and thighs attached by a smouldering spine. hedrien, stapled to the wall by a broken bayonet blade through the chest. jeorjul, without a face or a left foot, his gun still firing in spasming hands. he saw a man he couldn't recognise because his head had been vapourised. another that was just pieces of meat and bone wrapped in burning shreds of puzzle-camo. zhyte screamed and fired. he heard heavy weapon fire, and laughed like a maniac as tracers whinnied down the hall and tore through the front ranks of the advancing blood pact. zhyte fell dumb, like a stunned drunk, shock setting in. his trousers were soaked red with his blood. dyed red. like the blood pact. they were in the doorway. three four two. belthini was dragging him through. he couldn't see singis, but he fell sidelong across the hatch opening, and saw bothris and manahide manning the .50 cal cannon, raking the enemy with tracer tire. three four two. at least he thought he said it. he couldn't hear his own voice and they didn't seem to hear him. there was blood welling up in his throat. everything went quiet. zhyte could see the furious flashes of the .50's barrel. the lancing tracers. the las impacts all around. he could see men's mouths moving, yelling. manahide. bothris. belthini, in the doorway, over him, a look on his face that seemed touchingly concerned. between belthini's legs, zhyte saw the blood pact. they had rhindemann. they were hacking him apart with their bayonets. he was vomiting gore and screaming. zhyte couldn't hear him. he could hear nothing but his own pounding heart. he sagged. belthini stooped over him. belthini said something. zhyte suddenly realised he could smell something. something sharp, pungent. ozone. it was ozone. his head fell sideways. his skull bumped against the floor, and glanced off the sill of the hatch. he saw the little box in the hatch frame, wired to the power sockets in the wall. there was a light flickering inside it. ozone. he crawled. crawled forward. he was sure he said something important, but belthini was looking over at the gun team and didn't hear him. there was a flash. just a bright flash, as if light had suddenly become solid, as if the air had suddenly become hard. he tasted smoke and heat. zhyte looked back in time to see the void shield engage across the doorway, chopping manahide and bothris in two, along with their .50, which exploded. it was quite amazing. a boiling fog of blood and atomised metal. men falling apart, torsos and skulls cut vertically like scientific crosssections. he saw smoothly severed white bone, sectioned brains, light coming in through manahide's open mouth as the front of his face and body spilled forward on the other side of the shield. two sliced portions of human meat slumped back next to him, their edges curled and sizzling from the void field. zhyte looked up and saw belthini trapped on the other side of the shield, his image distorted and blurred by the energy. he was shouting, desperate, hammering his fists. no sound came through. belthini was hit from behind by about six or seven las-rounds. he realised the pain in his leg was gone. and then he realised that was because his legs were still on the other side of the shield. four he was the only one in the group who could see the stars. they were hidden behind the black on black cloud cover that roiled across the heavens above the secondary dome, but he, and only he, could detect their light spill. sergeant dohon domor was known affectionately as shoggy domor by the men of the regiment. he'd been blinded in action back on menazoid, years ago now as it seemed to him. he'd become quite used to the bulbous augmetic optics that crudely replaced his eyes. shoggy domor. a shoggy was a little amphibian with bulging eyes found in the woodland pools on tanith. he corrected himself: an extinct amphibian. the nickname had stuck. domor tried his micro-bead one last time, but there was nothing but static fizzle. they were out of range, and their main gain vox-sets, both of them, had gone down with the drop, still attached to vox-officers liglis and gohho. he walked with careful steps up the dome's treacherous curve to rejoin the team. his augmetic eyes whirred and adjusted to reduce the light glare from the mill stacks ahead. the tips of the chimneys showed as flaring yellow, the stacks themselves as orange. the figures of the men were red shadows and beyond them the night cooled into shapes of blue, purple and black. pollution mutants. they feed on the slugs. but we should be all right. they don't usually come in close to the cities. they're deep sky hunters. he turned the thin paper sheet bonin offered him in his gloved hands. vadim looked up so that bonin and mkeller could see his eyes behind the lenses of the hood. bonin seemed genuinely impressed. gaunt ordered, swinging his squad around. gaunt wasn't surprised. the shield effects distorted vox-links badly. the platoons led by varl, kolea and obel were cut off from the main force, deep in the heart of the enemy-held dome. as he moved his men around, down a wide stairwell and across a series of ransacked aerodrome hangars, gaunt tried to work out the enemy tactics. part of it seemed blindingly obvious: allow the imperial forces a foothold in the perimeter of the dome, and then deprive them of advance. the question was� what next? he didn't have to wait long to find out. the blood pact had been waiting. they hadn't withdrawn at all. they'd concealed themselves in false floors and behind wall panels. now the imperial invaders were penned in, they sprung their ambush, coming out in the midst of the confused guard units. guard units who no longer had any room to manoeuvre. the trooper next to colonel colm corbec turned to speak and then fell silent forever as a tracer round blew his head off. corbec yelled. he saw three troopers drop, and watched in horror as the metal-tiled flooring all around ruptured and punctured in a thousand places under the cascade of enemy shots. corbec crawled behind an overturned baggage cart that shook and bucked as rounds struck it. he tugged out his las-pistol and blasted through the mesh at indistinct figures on the gallery above. corbec fired another few shots with his pistol and tugged his remaining clip from his ammo-web, handing it to orrin. corbec was pretty sure none of his men had any more than a single clip of size three left after the initial assault. loaded, they might do this. they might hold. but running empty� it would be a matter of minutes until they were totally overwhelmed. already, he could see two or three of the best men in his squad � cisky, bewl, roskil, udir �crouching in cover, heads down, their ability to resist gone. they were out of ammo. corbec prayed with all his heart that someone, someone in authority� ornoff, van voytz, maybe even macaroth himself, would punish the simpletons in the munitorium who, for want of a signed docket had hung them all out to dry. corbec crawled forward to the end of the cart. someone was crying out for a medic, and corpsman munne was darting through the rain of fire to reach him, aid bag in his hand.  corbec fired his las-pistol up at the gallery. he had six clips � size twos - left for the handgun and that was his only arm now he'd given his last rifle pack to orrin. there had been a plentiful supply of size two pistol format in the drogue's stores. but few of the regular men carried pistols. he saw udir firing a solid-ammo revolver at the enemy. a trophy gun, taken on some past battlefield. a lot of ghosts cherished captured weapons. he hoped udir wasn't the only man in his squad to have kept his trophy with him and in working order. there was a blast of serious firepower from his left. surch and loell had managed to get the light support .30 onto its brass stand and were firing. their peals of tracers chased along the upper levels and several dismembered red figures tumbled down into the air shaft along with sections of stonework. told of the shortage of standard rifle packs before lift-off, corbec had wisely assigned troopers cown and irvinn to hump extra boxes of .30 shells for the support weapon. at least his land-hammer had some life in it yet. lancing beams of terrible force, bright white and apocalyptic, shafted down from the massing enemy. a tripod-mounted plasma weapon was corbec's best guess. he saw two of his men blown into flakes of ash by it. muril, a female vervunhiver with a heroic track record from the zoican war, was corbec's chosen sniper. rawne had once asked corbec why he'd personally selected muril for the second platoon � rawne seemed to have an unseemly interest in the female soldiers these days � and corbec had laughed and told him it was because muril had a deliciously dirty laugh and red hair that reminded him of a girl he'd been a fething fool to leave behind in county pryze. corbec urged her. she took the weapon off her shoulder. the gakking discharge from it� so bright� just about blinding me through the scope every time it fires. yeah, yeah, leaving her to refit her scope, corbec and mkvenner ran towards the stairhead, where the team with the .30 autocannon was doing its level best to stem the tide of the blood pact stormers charging down at them. the stairs were littered with bodies, body parts and gore. loell was winged and knocked down by a stray round, but cown leapt up to take over the ammo feed. the .30 was chattering, its air-cooled barrel glowing red-hot. corbec ordered, and shot the nearest enemy soldier with his pistol as he drew his warknife. the troops in his squad pressed forward, those that had power left firing, those that didn't using their lasrifles like spears, their warknives locked to the bayonet lugs. there was a brief, brutal struggle at the stairs. corbec stabbed and fired, at one point ending up with a blood pact trooper's iron mask caught around his knife, the blade through the eye-slit. he saw cisky drop, trying to hold in his ripped guts. he saw mkvenner halfway up the stairs, firing his last few rounds and killing an enemy with each one. he saw udir dubbing the brains out of a chaos trooper with his solid-ammo revolver, his last few bullets used up. a spear of flame ripped up the staircase, consuming the heads of enemy troops descending on them. corbec bellowed. furrian had grown up in the same wood-town as brostin, and shared his unhealthy enthusiasm for naked flames. the tanks on his back coughed and spat liquid promethium that the burner head in his hands ignited into blossoms of incandescent fire. now we're turning this, thought corbec, now we're fething turning this. a las-round hit furrian in the head. he twisted and fell, the flamer spurting weak dribbles of fire across the floor. then another las-round hit the tanks on furrian's back. the blast-wash of fire knocked corbec down. udir screamed as his clothes caught fire and he pitched off the staircase a blazing comet of struggling limbs. orrin lost his face to the flames, but not his life. he rolled on the floor, shrieking and squealing through a lip-less mouth, choking on the melted fat of his own skin. the blood pact poured in. they were met by mkvenner, cown and surch, the only men still standing at the stairhead after the blast. corbec struggled up, gasping, and saw something that would remain in his mind until his dying day: the most heroic display of last stand fighting he would ever witness. mkvenner was by then out of ammo, and cown had nothing but his tanith blade. surch was firing a laspistol, and had attached his warknife to a short pole. mkvenner swung his lasgun and decapitated the first enemy on him with the bayonet, las-rounds passing either side of him. he spun the weapon and smashed a chaos soldier down with the butt-end before ramming the blade into the belly of another. cown opened the torso of a blood pact trooper with a downward slash, and then punched his knife through the eye-slit of the iron grotesque that followed. there were enemy troopers surging all round them. surch shot two, then pistol-whipped another when his handgun ran dry. he drove an iron mask back into the face behind it with the dumb end of his makeshift spear shaft and then sliced it round to cut the right hand off another of their visored foes. the warknife flew out of cown's hand as a blood pact trooper with a short sword all but tore his arm off. cown fell down, cursing, and then grabbed a drum magazine from beside the .30.  he used it to beat the swordsman to death before passing out across him. surch killed four more and wounded a fifth before a las-shot hit him in the knee, dropped him and exposed him to the butt of an enemy gun. mkvenner� mkvenner was terrifying. he was using his lasrifle as a quarter staff, spinning it and doing equal damage with the stock end as with the blade. urlock gaur's chosen finest tumbled away from him on either side, cut, clubbed or smashed over by his heavy boots. lanky and long, mkvenner kicked like a mule and moved like a dancer. mkoll had once told corbec that mkvenner had been trained in the martial tradition of cwlwhl, the allegedly lost fighting art of the tanith wood-warriors. corbec hadn't believed it. the wood-warriors were a myth, even by tanith's misty standards. but as he gazed at mkvenner then, corbec could believe it. mkvenner was so fast, so steady, so direct. every hit counted. every swing, every strike, every counter-spin, every stab. the wood-warriors of ancient tanith lore had fought in the old feudal days, using only spear-staves tipped with single edged silver blades. they had united tanith and overthrown the huhlhwch dynasty, paving the way for the modern democratic tanith city-states. mkvenner seemed to corbec like a figure from the fireside tales of his childhood. the nalsheen, the wood-warriors, the fighters of legend, masters of cwlwhl. no wonder mkoll had such a special admiration for mkvenner. but even he, even a nalsheen, couldn't withstand the assault forever. corbec stumbled to join him, firing wildly with his laspistol. he fell, halfway up the steps. then light and dazzling streams of las-fire sliced into the pouring foe from the top of the stairs. sergeant bray's platoon had found them, moving along a higher level to fall on the blood pact from the rear. twenty-five strong, bray's squad quickly slaughtered the enemy and wiped the upper gallery clear. bray himself hurried down the steps, pausing only to finish off a couple of wheezing, twitching blood pact fallen, and joined corbec. panted corbec. kolea shrugged. he wasn't that stupid. kolea knew what the tanith-born sergeant meant. they were, it seemed, cut off from the main force now. the last few transmissions received from gaunt had spoken about shields or something. now there was nothing but ominous vox-hiss. the three platoons under varl, kolea and obel, numbering some seventy men, were deep in the secondary dome and utterly without support. they had moved, cautiously, through block after block of deserted worker habitats, places that had presumably been looted and abandoned when the blood pact had first taken cirenholm. little, tragic pieces of evidence were all that showed this had once been an imperial town: a votive aquila from a household shrine tossed out and smashed in the street; two empty ale bottles perched on a low wall; a child's toy lasgun, carved from monofibre; clothes hanging on a washing line between habs that had been left so long they were dirty again. on the end wall of one hab-terrace was a large metal noticeboard that had once proudly displayed the workforce's monthly production figures, along with the names of the star workers. someone had taken a lasgun to the sign, holing it repeatedly, before resorting to a flamer to burn off most of the paint. kolea looked at it sadly. both it, and the hab area they were in, reminded him of the low-rent hab-home he had lived in with his family in vervunhive. he'd worked number seventeen deep working for over a decade. sometimes, at night, he'd dream of the smell of the ore-face, the rumble of the drills. sometimes, he'd dream of the faces of his workmates, trug vereas, lor dinda. there'd been a proudly maintained production notice in their hab-block too. kolea's name had appeared on it more than once. the workers who had lived here had been employed by cirenholm's vapour mill. kolea wondered where they had gone, how many of them were still alive. had the blood pact slaughtered the population of cirenholm's domes, or were the poor devils penned up somewhere? he looked back down the street block. it was broken and ruined, and made all the more dingy by the dirty yellow light shining down from the girdered roof. at least when his exhausting shifts down number seventeen deep working had been done, he'd risen to daylight and open air, to the sun rising or setting behind the artificial mountain of vervunhive. the ghosts were prowling down the streets, checking the habs on either side. varl had insisted on room-to-room checking, and it made sense. they hadn't seen an enemy since they'd first broken into the inner dome areas. the blood pact could be dug in anywhere. this hadn't turned into the straight fight they had been expecting. not at gakking all. obel stood with a fireteam at the head of the street, looking out into a small market yard that had served the worker habs. shops and businesses were boarded up or ransacked. he led him into a broken down store that had once been the paymaster's office. munitorium crests were painted on the walls. kolea scowled when he saw them. his opinion of the imperial munitorium was miserably low. he didn't know a man in their section of the company who had more than one las-cell remaining now. obel opened a drawer in the paymaster's brass desk, a raised mechanical lectern, with cable-sockets that showed it had once needed a cybernetic link to an authorised official in order to operate. the clamps had been broken and the drawer now rolled free and loose. kolea was amazed to see the slots were still full of coins. kolea wondered. obel picked a coin out of the tray and held it up. it was defaced. someone with a makeshift tool, formidable strength and an obsessive amount of time on their hands, had crushed the coin and obliterated the emperor's head. in its place was a crudely embossed rune. it made him queasy just to look at it. obel tossed the coin back. kolea shuddered. every coin in the tray was the same.  it was a strangely little thing, but somehow more horrifying than the sights of destruction and desecration he'd seen in his time. the arch-enemy wanted to take the imperium and reshape every last little piece of it in his own image. outside, kolea saw the hand-daubed words that the blood pact had painted on the walls. words he didn't understand, made of letters he didn't know, mostly, but some were written in low gothic. names. urlock gaur, he knew, was the warlord controlling the main enemy strengths in this sector of the war, a fiend who commanded the loyalty of the blood pact. gaunt had spoken of him with a mixture of revulsion and respect. he wasn't too sure about. the commanding officers had mentioned several of gaur's field commanders, and kolea was pretty certain slaith had been one of them. perhaps he was the devil behind the war here on phantine. varl wandered up and joined the both of them. he asked them. obel shrugged. yes, the mill. think how bad it could be. we could be the only ones left, and if we are, that means we'll not be getting out of here in one piece. let's hurt them with what we have left. on the far side of the marketplace, larkin scooted in through the doorway of another smashed shop, taking care not to kick up the broken glass on the floor. he held his long-las ready. baen and hwlan, the scouts from varl and kolea's squads, had moved forward with fireteams to clear the west side of the market, and they'd taken the snipers with them. larkin looked round and saw bragg behind him in the doorway, covering the line of open street with his heavy cannon. caill was close by, shouldering the ammo hoppers for bragg's support weapon. larkin shook his head. he stepped back out onto the street fenix, garond and unkin hurried past, covering each other as they went into the next tumbled set of premises. larkin could see rilke and nessa, his fellow snipers, positioned in good cover behind a stack of rotting crates, guarding the northern approach to the market hub. larkin moved on, slightly more comfortable with the idea of bragg and his firepower flanking him. his sharp eyes suddenly caught something moving in a shop that ifvan and nour had supposedly already cleared. as a rule, mad larkin didn't do brave. he preferred to lie back, pick his targets and leave the hero stuff to the likes of varl and kolea. but he was getting edgy. he wanted something to shoot at before he snapped, or before the tension dredged up another of his killer headaches from the dark sludge at the bottom of his brain. he licked his lips, looked over at bragg, who nodded reassuringly over the heavy barrel of his .50, and kicked in the old wooden door. larkin swept his long-las from side to side, peering into the gloom. dust swirled up in the sickly light that shafted in through the door and the holes in the shutters. larkin lowered his weapon. but. cuu laughed. cuu gestured to a small iron strong box that lay open on the shop counter. larkin looked into the box. it was half full of coins. cuu began pocketing some more and tossed a handful down the dirty counter to larkin. larkin picked one up. it seemed like an imperial coin, but the faces had been messed up. cuu looked round at him, a nasty sneer on his face. he was looking in through the doorway behind larkin. cuu didn't. he pushed past larkin, and then stepped past bragg into the street. whup! milo! left! milo's left foot found the rim and he eased his right over on to it. he gasped. let go and reach out. milo was perspiring so hard now he felt like his whole skin might just slip off. that, and the persistent voice. milo tried, but his balance was shot. milo rolled on his back, panting, and saw vadim looking own at him in the sub-light. the verghastite was smiling. milo nodded.  he looked back through the inspection plate vadim had hauled him in through. below, far below, now he lad a better angle, he could see the massive turning blades of the fan. whup! whup! milo! hold fire and stay low! milo looked behind him. lillo was further back down the deck than either himself or bonin. the verghastite started firing on semi-auto, squirting quick bursts of fire at the figures emerging from the airlock. the shots streamed down the deckway past milo at hip height. the enemy troops immediately focused their attention on lillo, firing at him and moving down the deck towards him, hugging cover. milo could see bonin's simple but inspired tactic at once. lillo was drawing the enemy out, stringing them between milo and bonin's firing positions. the enemy were closer now. milo could see their faces were in fact metal masks, cruel and rapacious. he could smell the stink of their sweat and unwashed clothes. these have to be blood pact he thought. his skin crawled. he tightened his grip on his lasrifle. his ripple of shots punched into a bulkhead, missing the blood pact trooper who hunched against it. the masked warrior whipped around at the now close source of opposition and milo corrected his hasty aim, putting two rounds into the enemy's face. bonin had opened up too, deftly cutting down two of the blood pact as they were crossing for better cover and a better angle on lillo. a sudden silence. by milo's reckoning, there were still three of them left. he could hear one creeping slowly towards the row of fuel drums concealing bonin, but his own cover blocked his view. milo got down and slowly pulled himself round on his belly. he could almost see his target. a shadow on the deck showed that the trooper was almost on top of bonin. milo lunged out of cover, firing twice. he hit the blood pact trooper and sent him tumbling over, wildly firing the full-auto burst he had been saving for bonin. there was a fierce cry. milo looked round to see another of the blood pact charging him, shooting. las-rounds exploded off the plating behind him, nicking the stock of milo's weapon and burning through his left sleeve. bonin appeared out of nowhere, leaping off the barrels full length. he smashed into the charging foe, the impact carrying them both over hard into the deck's handrail. the scout threw a savage uppercut, and his silver warknife was clenched in his punching fist. screaming, the enemy clutched his neck and face and fell backwards off the deck. a single las-shot rang out. the last blood pact trooper had been running back for the airlock. lillo had cut him down with one, well-judged round. lillo hurried forward. said milo. got a bit ahead of myself. bonin said nothing. he didn't have to. vadim knew his mistake. they approached the massive metal staircase and followed t up into the roof space. the captured keys let them through locked cage doors one by one. it would have taken them tours to cut or blow their way through. at the top of the stairwell there was a greasy metal platform with a ladder up to a ceiling hatch. bonin climbed up and tried the keys until he found one that disengaged the blast-proof lock on the hatch. orange hazard lights began spinning and flashing around the platform as the hatch opened to the night and freezing air billowed in. there was no helping it. time was against them. the team they'd taken out would be missed soon anyway. bonin climbed out onto the roof and voxed to domor and the main force. it took about fifteen minutes for them to struggle up through the mill's superstructure and get into the hatch. bonin sent the first few troopers to arrive down the stairwell with milo and lillo to secure the base and the access to the deck. as soon as the last man was inside, bonin closed and relocked the hatch. the hazard flashers shut down. down on the deck, those troopers � like seena and arilla � who had come through the drop crash minus weapons helped themselves to the battered, old-pattern lascarbines belonging to the blood pact. avoiding the airlock, they continued on down the stairwell until they reached the main floor of the turbine chamber. it was dark and oily, with a low-level smog of exhaust smoke, but the darkness and the noise swallowed them up. mkeller and bonin, working from the map, snaked them through the sump levels of the mill, between the turbine frames, under walkframes, over coils of pressurised pipes. moisture dripped down, and unwholesome insect vermin scuttled in the corners. somewhere high above them, light shone out. the ghosts froze. light from an opened hatch or airlock spread out across one of the upper catwalks, and they saw a line of figures hurrying along the walk onto a raised deck level. a moment later, and more light appeared. another group, more soldiers, lamps bobbing as they crossed an even higher walkway, moving to support the first. bonin and milo had dumped the blood pact dead off the deck into the darkness of the sump, but there had been no disguising the las-damage to the deck area. once it seemed safe to move again, they filed along the narrow companionways of the sump, and reached an inner hatch that opened with a turn of the digital keys. in fireteam formations now, jagdea protected in one of the middle groups, they went through into a main service corridor, round in cross-section with heavy girder ribs. dull blue lights glowed out of mesh boxes along the backbone of the roof. the corridor wound away, passing junctions, crossways, stairwells and elevator hatches. haller grew increasingly uncomfortable, and he could see it in the faces of the verghastites too. it was a maze. they'd turned so many times, he wasn't even sure of basic compass orientation anymore. but the tanith seemed confident. corbec had once told haller that the tanith couldn't get lost. it wasn't in their genes, he reckoned. something to do with the perpetually mystifying pathways of that homeworld forest they were forever banging on about. now he believed it. bonin, who like all the tanith scouts had a grim-set face that never seemed to find much to be cheerful about, didn't even consult the map anymore. he paused occasionally to check stencilled wall signs, and once backed them up and rerouted them up a level via a stairwell. but his confidence never wavered. they came at last to a small side hall that seemed particularly dingy and long out of use. they were, by haller's estimation, in the very basement levels of the city dome, lower even than the mill sump levels. racks of old, cob-webbed work coveralls and crates of surplus industrial equipment had been stacked there out of the way. most of the rooflights had gone. there was a door at the far end. a metal hatch, painted blue with a flaking white serial stencil. bonin paused, and looked over at mkeller. the other scout, an older man with greying hair shaved in close to the sides of his head, returned the look with a nod. the blast ripped down the length of the stateroom, shredding the painted wood panelling, dashing up the polished floor tiles and tearing one of the crystal chandeliers off the roof. the chandelier crashed and rolled like a felled, crystal tree. its twin wilted and swayed from the ceiling. the wispy blue smoke began to clear. gaunt blinked away the tears that the smoke had welled up, and coughed to clear his throat. he looked around. though some were brushing litter off themselves, the ghosts in his squad seemed to have weathered the powerful explosion. gaunt growled over his micro-bead. his squad, along with those of theiss, ewler and skerral, were dug in at their heels, holding off the mounting assaults of the blood pact. drawing his sword and powering it up, gaunt ran forward with derin and beltayn, following the lead team of caober, wersun and starck. debris crunched underfoot. gaunt's boot caught a crystal twig of chandelier and it went tinkling away across the dust. before he'd even reached the grand doorway at the end, he heard caober's snarl of frustration and knew what it meant. the shield was still intact. � but there was no point giving that signal. they were penned into the outer levels of the secondary dome by the shield wall to one side and the blood pact to the other. there was nowhere to retire to, and no hope of calling up an evac. even if the drop fleet had returned to the drogue and refuelled, as they were supposed to do, the enemy held the dz now, the only viable landing zone. biota had expected them to win, gaunt thought. dammit, he had expected them to win. cirenholm should have been tough, but not this fething tough. they had seriously underestimated the resolve and strategic strength of the blood part. tarnash? this is one. do your best. a transmission cut across abruptly. gaunt looked desperately back at the shield, the real enemy. it was denying him every possibility of constructing a workable defence. all i figure is this shield system must be running off the city power supply. it must be sucking up a feth of a lot of juice to stay this coherent. he yelled at the crew of the .30. bonin kept the headset pressed to his ear and looked over with a desperate shrug to nirriam, who was trying to adjust the big vox-unit. the verghastite complained, now down under the desk unplugging the switch cables one by one to blow on them. domor came over, pausing to check on dremmond, guthrie and arilla who sat on the floor leaning against the wall, resting. fayner was checking their wounds. domor asked. bonin made an off-hand gesture in the direction of nirriam. nirriam snorted. nirriam leaned past him and gently turned a dial, as if it might actually do some good. as if to prove it wasn't, there was a sudden yowl of trash noise before gaunt's voice continued. 5536. which meant� the mill. the main control room of the vapour mill. feth! fall back, hold on, and pray. when i give the word, follow your deployment orders immediately. bonin asked. he was answered by sighs and shaken heads.  fething woman! bonin thought he might strike her. he looked around the control room, trying to perceive the mysteries of the vast mechanism. he felt like a child. it was hopeless. he was a soldier, not a fething tech-priest. he had no idea how to shut down a vapour mill. haller groaned. he strode over to the nearest workstation and pulled a brass lever. there was absolutely no perceptible change in anything. he shrugged. domor nodded. bonin glanced round. it was jagdea, her slung arm looking more uncomfortable than ever. bonin cursed at the thought. sarge! sarge! corbec was yelling, standing up and waving his arms despite the enemy crossfire splashing all around. the ghosts in his squad, along with bray's troops, dashed back through the hatchway, a rain of fire dropping around them. irvinn scrambled on. corbec looked back in time to see two more ghosts fall on their way to the hatch. one was widden, whose body was struck so hard by .50 fire it was deformed completely. the other was muril. she was hit and thrown in a cartwheel that ended with her lying on her face. colm! sergeant bray yelled. corbec howled, running out from the hatchway towards muril. las-fire ripped up the deck around him, filling the air with a fog of atomised tiles. somehow, he reached muril. he rolled her over. her face was white with dust and dotted with blood that soaked into the dust like ink into clean blotting paper. he shouted. medic! bray was yelling. corbec realised he couldn't move. everything felt strangely warm and soft. he lay on his back, looking at the panelled roof. it seemed to slide up and away from him. the last thing he heard was bray still screaming for a medic. viktor hark fired his plasma pistol into the knots of foe around the doorway. the combined squads of rawne, daur and meryn were spread out and dropping back through the dead park. there was nothing behind them except shield-blocked hatches. they'd given up valuable ground on gaunt's orders. there had been nothing in return. hark fired again. they were going to be killed. one by one, with the shield at their backs. sergeant agun soric, hero of vervunhive, sat back against the wall. the wound in his chest was sucking badly, and bloody foam was bubbling around the seared entry hole. slowly, he raised his lasgun in one hand, but the weight of it was too much. men in red with metal grotesques were prowling forward towards him through the smoke. sergeant theiss knelt beside him, coming out of nowhere. soric heard theiss yell. soric felt himself being lifted. doyl and mallor were under him, and lanasa had his feet. well� the first of the blood pact hit the vapour mill control chamber along the upper passage. seena returned their fire until ezlan and nehn joined her. her gunfire was punctuated with curses about the .30 she should have been firing. it was a narrow hall, and the three ghost guns could hold it� unless the enemy brought up something more punishing. three minutes after the upper hatch was assaulted, the lower main door guarded by mkeller came under fire. he saw a grenade slung his way in time to slam the heavy iron hatch shut. the blast shook the door. haller ran up and helped mkeller throw the lock bolts on the corners of the hatch. lwlyn, stationed in the other main floor doorway, suddenly fell back on his backside with a curse. blood soaked out across his battledress from his left shoulder. ferocious las-fire ripped in through his hatchway. two bolts struck lwlyn's unconscious form sprawled in the open and made sure he would never wake up. guthrie reached the door and yanked it shut as las-fire hammered on the outside. guthrie yelled. bonin glanced at domor. domor shrugged. bonin dropped down in a crouch in front of her and scooped up the poison pills. it may only be a soldier's ignorant philosophy, but in the guard, we keep fighting to the end. if we die, we die. bonin dropped the tablets onto the floor and crushed them with his heel. bonin ignored the sarcasm. tanith first-and-only, ma'am. we look after our own. seena sang out to the chamber. the combined squads of obel, kolea and varl moved in through the upper gallery and joined up with haller and domor's units. it was all very calm, matter of fact. there were a few handshakes and greetings. no whooping, no cheering, nothing to betray the elation they all felt. nothing to acknowledge the dazzling fortune that had just turned their way. by then, nearly psychotic levels of blood pact opposition were thrashing in at the main ground floor hatchways. varl sent the flamers to subdue it. really? now, now, now! men of tanith, men of verghast! a reappraisal of combat policy cirenholm city occupation, phantine 214 to 222. � antonid biota, chief imperial tactician, phantine theatre one swollen plumes of brown fire-smoke drifted up from the south-facing edges of cirenholm's trio of domes, and diluted into yellow smog in the hard morning sunlight. from the upper observation deck of the primary dome, it was difficult to believe phantine was a toxic world. the bright sun made the high altitude sky powder-blue and, down below the sculptural curves of the domes, great oceans of knotted white cloud spread out as far as the eye could see. only occasionally was there a dark stain or a ruddy surge of flame visible beneath the clouds as the inferno of the scald underlit them. like a pod of great sea mammals, the drogues were coming in. eight of them, each a kilometre long from nose-ram to tail fins, coasting along on the morning wind, their taut silver and white skins gleaming. pairs of tiny, fast moving lightnings crossed between them, making repeated low passes over the city. gunships, weapon-mounted variants of the drops that had brought them to cirenholm, slunk along beside the vast drogues in escort. it was cold up on the observation deck. the city's heating systems were still off-line. it was taking a long time to get the vapour mill running back to optimum after the sudden shutdown. gaunt pulled his long storm coat tight. ice crystals were forming on the glass of the observation port, and he wiped them off with a gloved hand. there was something infinitely relaxing about watching the drogues approach. he could just hear the distant chop of their massive prop banks. that look in your eyes. gaunt frowned. corbec's the heart of the tanith first. everyone loves him. we lose him, it'd be a body blow to all. but soric is cut from the same doth. he means a lot to the verghastites. if he dies, i think it'll knock the stuffing out of the verghast sections of the regiment. yes, him especially. but not just him. it's an honour thing. gaunt nodded without replying. he was well aware of the way hark was testing him. hark was a loyal man, and had begun to perform his duties as regimental commissar impeccably. but he was always testing boundaries. gaunt chuckled. gaunt frowned. the scout elite has always been mkoll's area. i happily bow down to his expertise, i always have. if he thinks any of that list can make the grade, he'll take them. hark seemed satisfied with this, but then he surprised gaunt with a final comment. making us do a rethink, gaunt. a radical rethink. ouranberg awaits, gaunt, and your work here has prompted us to make a hasty reappraisal of combat policy. ibram gaunt didn't know quite what to think. onti flyte regarded herself as a true imperial citizen, and had raised her three children in that manner. when the archenemy had come to cirenholm, and overrun it so fast, she'd felt like the sky had fallen in. her husband, a worker in the mill, had been killed by the part in the initial invasion. onti, her children and her neighbours, had been herded out of their habs by the masked brutes and shut up in a pen in the bowels of tertiary. it had been hellish. precious little food or water, no sanitation. the place had stunk like a drain by the end of the first day. after that there had been disease and dirt, and the stench had become so high she could no longer smell it. now, as the imperial guard escorted them back to their habs, she could smell the stink. it was in her clothes and in her hair. she knew the streetblock shower would have queues, and the laundry would be full to bursting, but she wanted her kids clean and dressed in fresh clothes. that meant getting the outhouse tub full, and hard work with the press. a nice young guardsman in black called caffran had seen her and the kids back to their hab. onti had kept apologising for the way they smelled. the boy, caffran, had been so polite and kind. it was only when she was back in her place, in the little parlour of her terraced hab, that she'd cried. she realised how much she missed her husband, and she was haunted by what the arch-enemy had undoubtedly done to him. her children were running around. she wanted them to quiet down. she was beside herself. the nice soldier � caffran � looked in on her as the streets outside swarmed with people returning to their homes under escort. he asked. onti flyte went into the outhouse and dragged off her filthy clothes. naked and wrapped in a threadbare towel, she was testing the water with her hand when she heard the creak. she looked up and froze, realising someone was crouching in the back of the outhouse. she felt vulnerable. she felt open. for a terrifying moment she thought it was one of the archenemy, gone to ground. one of the foul, masked blood part. but it wasn't. the figure stepped out of the shadows. it was a fine young guardsman. the soldier didn't. onti flyte suddenly realised that she was in trouble. really bad trouble. she opened her mouth, but nothing came out. the soldier stepped forward. he was very distinctive looking. he had a knife. a long, straight silver knife that shone against the black fabric of his battledress. she felt a scream building inside her. this wasn't right. she screamed anyway. for a very short time. no, boy. � he grabbed milo by the head with both hands and examined his eyes, dragging the lids aside with firm fingertips. not one in my power to give , i'm afraid. verghast. dorden made a sour face, the sort of sour face he always made when confronted by naive soldier ways. the blood pact had lice and now they're gone, the lice are looking for new lodgings. the poor phantine found their billets in tertiary were infested. his name, he had told daur, was fultingo, and he was attached to admiral ornoff's staff. daur thought that was a particularly brave response from the junior officer. she'd joined them from the billet rows, her brow knotted. she pushed past the officers and the escort and knelt beside a small, grubby boy who was holding onto the last trooper's coat tails and trying not to cry. yes. beggi flyte. eldest son of onti flyte, cirenholm mill-wife. real sacra! real, ghosty-man! a one-legged hawker showed off talismans of the emperor, tanith badges and aquila crests. another, his face sewn together, produced chronometers, nightscopes and contraband micro-beads. yet another, limbless and moving thanks to a spider-armed augmetic chassis, displayed lho-sticks, cigars and several stronger narcotics. a juggler tumbled past. a mime artist, her face yellow and stark, performed the death of solan to an appreciative crowd. a small boy ran through the crowd, running a hoop with a stick. he looked round. it wasn't livy. the camp-girl was actually pretty, though far too heavily made-up. her dark-lashed eyes were bright and vivid. a beauty spot sat on her powdered cheek. she smiled at kolea, her long skirt bunched up either side of her hips in her lace-gloved hands as she posed coquettishly. her large, round breasts might as well have been bared given the flimsiness of the satin band that restrained them. on the nightstand, please. he climbed on to the heap of cushions, and crawled across past aleksa. she lay back, watching him. kolea reached the wall of the tent and parted the silk around the slit aleksa had made for him. kolea smiled. i've got to know her, the time she spends here. she'd understand. she'd be� oh, i don't know. kolea took one last look through the slit. dalin had made a paper boat for yoncy and they were sailing it down the murky gutter. fultingo dropped his voice. daur knew it was for show. a warknife was a ghost's most treasured possession. they didn't lose them. and they made sure their dead always went to the grave with their straight silver. hark demanded. hark looked round at daur and curth. but this witch hunt's gone far enough. the boy's been through the halls and he hasn't recognised anyone. there's been a mistake. hark led them out into the corridor away from the men. it was cold, and condensation dribbled from the heating pipes that ran along the wall. i have no animosity towards the urdeshi. i've actually admired their fortitude since balhaut� asked shenko, his eyes wide. we're going into the next theatre together soon. confetti streamed in the wind, and citizens pushed forward to hang paper garlands around the necks of their liberators and kiss their hands. real flowers had vanished from phantine eight centuries before, except for a few precious blooms raised in specialist hortivatae. but the paper mills still functioned. with a garland of paper lilies around his neck. gaunt made his way slowly through the crush on the square, shaking the hands thrust at him. he caught sight of a particularly striking officer dutifully shaking hands. it was rawne. gaunt smiled. he so seldom saw rawne in full ceremonial regalia, it was a shock. the suturing around his blood-shot eye made his glare even angrier than usual. zweil had a half dozen garlands round his neck. they pushed to the edge of the crowd and, with hands aching, made off down a side street. even then they were stopped several times to be kissed, hugged or thanked. gaunt chuckled, but rawne wasn't amused. zweil toyed wistfully with the paper blooms around his neck. gaunt nodded. uhh� no, sir. rawne growled. the bar owner returned with a pathetically dented tray on which sat three shot glasses of different sizes and a bottle of amasec. he set the glasses down in front of the trio. no, we're not. well, not really. at battle's end, colm corbec would have sniffed out the nearest bar and done just that. today, he can't. rawne asked. gaunt looked round at him. rawne scowled. gaunt held his glass but didn't drink. ouranberg. he covered his empty glass to stop rawne filling it. one for colm, one for soric. that would do. said rawne humourlessly. said zweil. zweil cried. but the colonel-commissar was running up the steps into the street and gone. viktor hark backed across the room, bumped into a filing cabinet and realised there was nowhere left to retreat to. hark rose slowly. hark straightened his jacket and looked at gaunt. hark shook his head. hark shook his head sadly. varl found his way to the infirmary by following the scent of disinfectant it was confusing at first because almost every hallway and access in the secondary dome smelled of the stuff. there were munitorium and civil work gangs all over the city hosing down floors and scrubbing away the reek and filth of the enemy. but the infirmary had a stink of its own. disinfectant. blood. the taskforce medicae had occupied an apprentices' college on one of the mid-level floors, close by the dome skin. the walls and roofs of some of the larger rooms demonstrated the gentle curve of the city's shape. flakboard and shielding raised by the enemy had been stripped away from the windows to let in the cool light. outside, through thick, discoloured armourglas, the pearly cloudscape spread away as far as the eye could see. the place was busy. varl edged his way in between weary nurses and arguing orderlies, bustling corpsmen resupplying their field kits from a dispensary, cleaning crews, walking wounded. every chamber he passed was full of casualties, mainly urdeshi, supported in crude but functional conditions. the worst cases were screened off in side wards. the smell of pain was inescapable, and so was the low, background murmur of groans. varl slid his back to a wall to allow two medicae orderlies hurrying along with a resuscitrex cart to pass, and then entered the gloom of an intensive ward. the lighting was low-level, and trained around the individual beds. there was a steady, arrhythmic bleep of vitalators and the asthmatic wheeze and thump of the automatic respirator bellows. corbec lay on a rumpled cot, half-tangled in khaki sheets, like a shroudwrapped pieta in an imperial hero shrine. his limbs were sprawled, knotted in the fabric, as if he had turned restlessly in his dreams. drips and monitor cables were variously anchored into his massive arms and chest, and his mouth and nose were plugged with larger, thicker tubes. it looked as if they were choking him. corbec's eyes were sealed with surgical tape. through his thick, black body hair it was possible to see the yellowing bruises and the hundreds of little, scabby cuts that marked his skin. varl stood looking at him for a long time and realised he couldn't think of anything to say or do.  he wasn't even sure why he'd come. the old doctor asked, coming over, his attention half on a data-slate he was reviewing. been tanith in here all morning. in ones or twos. a few verghastites too. paying their respects. varl grinned. i wasn't looking for no reassurance. if he's going to die, i hope you'd tell me. i just don't feel it. standing there, i just don't. it doesn't feel like his time. like he's not ready and he's fething well not going to let go. you saw that too , huh? i haven't said that to anyone because i didn't want to get hopes up unfairly. varl drew dorden to one side, off the main corridor, into the entrance to one of the critical wards. i think� i think he doesn't care anymore. doesn't care about his own life. varl nodded and made his way out. the canvas curtain behind dorden slid back and curth came through, peeling off bloody surgical gloves and tossing them into a waste canister. dorden shook his head with a sigh. caffran slowly rose to his feet mystified. the shackles linking his wrists clanked and drew tight where they ran down to his ankle-hobble. he'd been stripped down to his black vest and fatigue pants. his boot laces and belt had been removed. his voice was dry and thin. the air in the dingy cell was damp and the light bad. a hunted look on caffran's face showed that he was still dealing with the shock of the accusations. kolea stared at him. the shadows made it impossible for caffran to read his expression. kolea stopped a few paces from caffran. he turned slowly. silhouetted, gaunt stood in the cell doorway. that's enough. you're out of line being here, kolea. you should know that. get out. he cleared his throat and then looked up, meeting gaunt's gaze. all i needed to hear, caff. gaunt stepped out into the brig hall. the commissariate guards closed the heavy door, threw the bolts and ignited the shield. they saluted gaunt, but he ignored them as he strode away. in the rain, the mill-habs looked especially dismal. it wasn't real rain, naturally. every two days, each section of the hab-district was sluiced with water from the dome's ceiling pipes. the idea was to maintain hygiene and keep the streets washed down. it simply made everything glisten with wet and smell like a stale toilet stall. the flyte household had been boarded, and aquila seals stamped to the doors. the kids had been sent to stay with neighbours. he jumped over the back fence into the rear yard and looked about his cloak pulled up over his head against the downpour.  if the outhouse was well roofed, then there might be some traces left to find. if it wasn't the rain would have rinsed everything of value away. he looked around, peering in through the cracked rear windows of the hab. all sorts of litter and broken debris was scattered in the weed-rife yard. he went into the outhouse, breaking the aquila seal and ignoring the stencilled commissariate warning notice. inside, it smelled of rotting fibreboard and mineral waste. there was no light it wasn't particularly watertight but he could still see the dark stains on the wall, the floor, and the rim of the old, battered tub. one was a handprint. a perfect handprint. a woman's. he looked around. the rafters were low, and there was a gash in one of them right above the bath. he took out a lamp pack and shone it up, probing the cut with the tip of his tanith knife, and carefully teased out a tiny sliver of metal that he put in his hip pouch. he sniffed the air. he sniffed the fibreboard wall. he got down on his hands and knees and shone the lamp-pack under the tub. something glinted. he reached for it. the young cadet commissar in the doorway looked very scared, an automatic pistol aimed at him. but credit where credit was due. he'd come up fething quietly. the cadet said. goosen? goosen covered him carefully as mkoll reached into the pocket and drew out a folded document. he held it out to the older man. goosen looked at the commissar. yes, i am, fultingo. gaunt obtained a delay order from commissar del mar's office an hour ago. we have a grace period to assess all the evidence. he looked angry, thwarted. mkoll nodded. daur shivered and looked about. the artificial rain was trickling to a stop, but the air was still filmy and damp. steam rose from heating vents and badly insulated roofing. water stood in great, black mirrors along the uneven street and in the ruts of the yard-back lane. daur could smell stove fires and the faint, unwholesome aroma of ration meals cooking. somewhere, children squealed and laughed as they played. although he couldn't see them, daur could feel the eyes in all the back windows of the hab-street, eyes peering out from behind threadbare drapes and broken shutters, watching them. mkoll nodded again and looked up. mkoll turned his penetrating gaze round and directed it at the taller verghastite officer. daur had always admired and liked the chief scout. said mkoll. yeah, right. mkoll wiped his wet face with a fold of his camo-cloak. three lord general van voytz had chosen a generous high gothic style manse in the upper levels of cirenholm's primary dome for a command headquarters. painted eggshell green, and supported by some of the integral pillars that rose up into the dome's roof structure, the manse was one of forty that overlooked a vast, landscaped reservoir complete with lawns and woodlands of aug-cultivated trees. this lakeland habitat, complete with pleasure yachts rocking in coves at the timber jetties, had been the playground of cirenholm's wealthiest and most influential citizens before the blood pact's arrival. two planetary senators, a retired lord general, a worthy hierarch, six mill tycoons and the city governor had all owned homes around the shore. all of them were dead now. there was no one left to object to van voytz's occupation. not that any of them would have. the liberating lord general had power and, more crucially, influence over them all. an imperial transport speeder still wearing its invasion camouflage skimmed gaunt over the lake. evening had fallen, and lights from the shoreline twinkled out over the dark water. despite the gloom, gaunt could see the burnt-out ruins of some of the properties, grim as skulls.  he could also see the silhouettes of crosses dotted along the shore. no one had found the time yet to take down the murdered worthies of cirenholm. the speeder slowed and ran up the little beach in front of the manse in a wash of spray. shielding their eyes from the drizzle urdeshi sentries waved the vehicle in. the speeder crossed a lawn and some low box hedges and settled on the arc of mica-shingled driveway outside the manse. gaunt stepped out into the night air, pulling on his storm coat. he could smell the water and the fading ozone reek of the cooling engines. two staff limos were pulling away from the front steps, and speeder bikes and other imperial transports sat parked under wet trees. there were more sentries on the steps. two of them, and van voytz's junior aide hurried down to meet him. gaunt walked into the light of the hall. it was a stunning interior of polished rethuric panels, gold-laced shaniffes and displays of antique porcelain. he wondered how the hell any of this had survived unbroken. the trompe l'oeil ceiling showed him vistas of the empyrean, complete with dogged starships. gaunt passed a side room which was bare apart from an enormous ormulu fireplace and a single escritoire lit by a floating glow-globe. the tactician, biota, sat working at the desk, veiled by holo displays and charts. he didn't look up. two urdeshi storm-troops hurried past in full kit. they broke step only to salute. the aide stopped outside a towering pair of gordian-wood doors. van voytz suddenly appeared from under the wide tactical desk. just his head and shoulders. van voytz's voice was partially muffled by the table. van voytz appeared again. they spared some things then? van voytz grinned. they both laughed. he sloshed some of the contents of the bottle into one of the empty glasses. van voytz asked, pointing at the book gaunt was holding. gaunt put the book back on the pile and gulped his drink. van voytz refilled his glass. this man � caffran is it? he's a dog soldier. a common trooper. the case against him is las-proof. i stand where i stand today because of the common dog soldiers. i would not be me without their efforts. van voytz rose and started to put his jacket back on. gaunt shrugged. van voytz shrugged. he didn't seem put out. while fumigation crews filled the billets with noxious chemical clouds, the ghosts reported en masse to a grand municipal bathhouse in primary. kit was stripped off for steam-cleaning, and the troops, shivering in their shorts and vests, lined up in the cold stone atrium to have their heads shaved. the buzz of three dozen clippers filled the air above the chatter. servitors shunted back and forth, sweeping up the hair for incineration. once shaved, the troops were sent through into the steaming shower blocks armed with cakes of tar-soap, their boots slung by the laces around their necks. on the far side of the shower blocks were halls lined with rush mats where stiffly-old but clean towels were stacked. munitorium aides stood by at trestle tables piled with clean reserve kit that stank of yet more powder. larkin was tugging a clean black vest over his bony torso and scowled at bragg as he heard his name called. oh, what now? gaunt glanced round at daur. the group broke up, muttering to one another. daur and gaunt turned together and walked off down the outer hall. larkin whispered anxiously to bragg as he finished lacing up his boots. bragg leaned beside him, pulling on his vest. he smiled. bragg laughed. cuu's a fething maniac, larks. if anyone in this mob is capable of that killing, it's him. if he's guilty, we don't have to worry about it. if he's innocent, well, then he gets off. and honestly, what would he do then? kill us? the billet hall was fairly quiet except for the occasional cough or sneeze. the sunk of the recent fumigation still clung to the air. milo expertly stowed the last of his kit in his backpack, lashed it shut and then secured the tightly rolled tubes of his bed-roll and camo-cloak to it. vadim, already packed and ready to go, wandered over to him. milo pulled on his tunic, checking the contents of the pockets, and then strapped on his webbing. he rubbed his sandpaper scalp. the lack of hair had altered the proportion of his head and made his strong nose seem almost beak-like. he looked like a dejected crow. they shook hands and exchanged banter with other ghosts as they crossed the hall. none of them had explained where they were going and no one had asked, but it was clear they were shipping out for some special duty and that prompted numerous farewells and wishes of luck. milo asked the three of them. they nodded. it was just after 18.00 and time to leave. milo looked across to larkin's cot. the master sniper was finishing up his almost obsessive prep on his gun, packing up the cleaning kit and sliding the long foul-weather cover over the weapon. bragg sat down on the cot next door. nour called. the sudden shout made the five troopers stop and turn. hark had entered the billet with sergeant burone and two other ghosts. all three troopers carried weapons. they marched down the aisle towards cuu's bunk. vadim whispered. hark snarled and cuu obeyed. the trooper frisking cuu unbuckled cuu's warknife from his sheath and passed it to the commissar. hark inspected the blade. cuu's entire kit was spread out across his cot, wherever possible taken apart. burone was checking the lining of cuu's backpack and musette bag. hark glanced round. kolea stood prominently in the group of ghosts who had gathered to watch. hark warned him. cuu stopped thrashing and the men frog-marched him forward. hark and burone fell in behind. as they swept past milo's group, cuu's cat-eyes found larkin. hark roared and they swept him out of the hall. bragg looked across at larkin and shrugged. he checked his watch. he threw a brief wave over at adare and meryn. banda snorted. like all of them, mkoll wore full matt-black fatigues and high-laced boots, and heavypouched webbing, with a full field kit and weapons on his back. the sleeves of his tunic were neatly rolled up past the elbows. he did a quick head count and then consulted his wristwatch. kersherin nodded and walked over to a dangling control box that hung down from the roof on a long, rubber-sleeved cable. he thumbed several switches. there were a series of loud bangs as the overhead light rigs came on one after another, quickly illuminating the entire, vast space of the hangar with cold, unfriendly light. on the far side, rising some thirty-five metres above a floor layered with foam cushion mats, stood a large scaffolding tower strung with riser cables and pulleys. four the execution yard was an unprepossessing acre of broken cement, walled in on three sides by high curtains of pockmarked rockcrete, and by the chamber of justice on the fourth. the chamber of justice, cirenholm's central law court and arbites headquarters, had suffered badly during the blood pact occupation. the uppermost floors of the tall, gothic revival building were burnt out, and the west end had been heavily shelled. most of the office and file rooms were ransacked. an immense chrome aquila, which had once hung suspended on the facade over the heavy portico, had been shot away by determined stubber fire, and lay crumpled and flightless on the main steps. on one side of the entry court sat a chilling heap of dented arbites riot helmets, a trophy mound raised by the blood pact after their defeat of the lightly armed justice officers who had staunchly held out to the last to defend this sector of the city. despite all that, the prison block below ground was still functioning and it was the only true high security wing that cirenholm could offer, and so the taskforce commissariate had been forced to occupy the chamber as best it could. from a window at the rear of the first floor, gaunt looked down onto the execution yard. the six-man firing squad, hooded and dressed in plain grey fatigues that lacked patches, insignia or pins, took absolution from the waiting ecclesiarch official with routine gestures, and then lined up and took aim. there was no fuss or ceremony. the hawkish commissar in charge, a black silk doth draped over his balding pate, raised a sabre and gave the command in a tired voice. the prisoner hadn't even been blindfolded or tied up. he just cowered against the back wall with nowhere to run. six las-shots, in a simultaneous flurry, spat across the yard and the prisoner toppled, rolling back to slide clumsily down the wall. the presiding commissar yelled out something else, and was already sheathing his sabre and taking off his black doth as the squad filed off and servitors rolled a cart out to collect the body. gaunt let the scorched brocade curtain fall back against the broken window and turned away. daur and hark, who had been watching from the neighbouring window, exchanged a few words and went to look for something to sit on. half-broken furniture was piled up along one wall of the battered stateroom. the tall, ten-panelled door opened and commissar del mar strode in. he was a lean man of advanced years, white-haired and reliant on augmetic limb reinforcements, but he was still striking and imposing. a good hand-span taller than gaunt, he wore black dress uniform with a purple sash and a long cloak lined with red satin.  today is full of punishment details and each one requires my authority and seal. he could feel the rigid armature of del mar's artificial hand through the glove. commissar try cuu for the crime. gaunt escorted commissar del mar to the session hall where inquisitor gabel's briefing was set to begin. gabel had been interrogating the captured blood pact since the first day of occupation and was now ready to present his findings so that the taskforce's senior officers and the strategic advisors could deliberate how the data might impact the plans for the assault on ouranberg. the session hall was a badly ventilated room packed with bodies, smoke and bad odours, but it was the only room in the chamber of justice large enough to contain the officers and support a large grade tactical holo-display. gesturing through the press of bodies, gaunt brought hark over to him. he's insisting we clear caff formally before they commit cuu. they keep telling me i should depend on my staff. feth, you keep telling me. so go do it and do it well. i want to expend no more than a morning on caffran's deposition. i can't afford any more. van voytz's been talking about going on ouranberg in less than a week. make a watertight case for caff so we can get it done with quickly hark paused. there was a strange expression on his face that gaunt had never seen before. it was strangely sympathetic yet baffled. hark saluted and pushed his way out of the room. gaunt shouldered his way over to daur. a hush fell as inquisitor gabel, a cadaverous monster in matt-rose powered plate armour, stalked to the centre of the room and activated the tactical desk with his bionic digits.  a hololithic display of ouranberg city flickered into life. we believe at least three packs of loxad mercenaries support him. thirty-five metres up, milo stood on the tower's unnecessarily narrow and flimsy stage, holding on to the rail with one hand. he was next. banda, mkvenner and kuren were waiting on the back of the stage behind him for their turns. the phantine trooper with him, cardinale, beckoned milo over as the pulleys were reset and the counterweight balanced. he checked milo's harness and tightened one of the straps. go! milo was picking himself up and taking a jokey bow to the scattered applause of his comrades. banda had taken her place up on the plank. oh, varl and adare, by a long way. doyl is too stiff. banda tries way too hard and it throws her out. you could do with pulling your knees up. they watched as banda leapt off the tower and whizzed down on the tension of the pulleys. a little later, once mkvenner and kuren had also made their fourth drops, kersherin gathered them round and sat them down on the mats in a semicircle. water bottles and ration wraps were passed out. there was a lot of chatting and joking as adrenalin fizzed its way out of them. kersherin said. babbist came forward to the front of the semi circle, and unterrio hurried in to deposit a field-kit sized crate in front of him before backing out. babbist opened the crate and lifted something out for them all to see. it was a compact but heavy metal backpack with a fearsome harness that included thigh loops, and a hinged arm with a moulded handgrip on the left side. the backpack sprouted two blunt, antler-like horns from the shoulders that ended in fist-sized metal balls. it was painted matt-green. accept no imitations. formal spec, for those that need it, is type five icarus-pattern personal descent unit with dual m12 gravity nullers and a variable-vent compressor fan for attitude control. which, i gather, many of you need. larkin slowly raised a hand. uh� is this just an interesting little lecture to occupy our minds during snack break � or should we conclude that at some point in our approaching yet ever fething shortening future, we're going to be strapped to one of those things and thrown into the sky? just asking. i mean, would we be right off the mark in connecting the� thrilling wire jumps we've been making off that lovely tower with a situation that combines one of those with a lot of screaming and looseness of bowel? and up we go � good. baulked larkin. right. just pull the yokes in a bit. that's it. more laughing. he reached over and pulled down the pack's hinged control arm. it now stuck out at waist height on larkin's left side, the joystick handgrip extending vertically in exactly the right place for his left hand to grasp it comfortably. he lifted a small plate marked with a purity seal on the right flank of the pack and threw two rocker switches. immediately the pack began to whine and throb, as if turbine power was building up inside it babbist closed the plate again. babbist had a gentle grip on the handstick. he softly depressed the red button. the red button determines grav lift, people. i'm just touching it and it's taking the weight of the pack. larkin gurgled to more laughter. he had risen twenty centimeters off the ground and hung there, feet dangling. babbist kept hold of the handgrip. he squeezed the button and larkin rose again. babbist yanked on the grip slightly and larkin gusted sideways slightly. he yelped. asked vadim gleefully. viktor hark set down his stylus and sat back in his chair. it was late, the dome lights had dimmed, and his office, a makeshift corner of a machine shop near the regiment billets, was getting cold. hark pushed aside the reams of notepaper and documents he had managed to accumulate, and picked up a data-slate. his thumb on the speed-scroll button, he surveyed the data. caffran, cuu, the evidence and witnesses for and against each of them. he sighed and tossed the slate aside. hark got to his feet, pulled on his leather storm coat and looked about for his cap. unable to locate it he decided he'd do without it. he walked to the door, went out, locked it carefully behind him, and made off in the direction of the stairs. he had drawn level with hark and now sat down on the steps. hark paused. he hadn't got time for this. he'd have to make time. he sat down on the gritty stairs next to zweil. he told me. hark said. i'm a man of the cloth! ayatani zweil � you say you're with us to answer the spiritual needs of the men. in clerical confidence, i believe? is this about caffran? viktor? as he was speaking, armed urdeshi soldiers walked caffran into the hall and stood him in the middle of the open side of the stage facing del mar. his wrists were manacled, but he had been allowed to shave and put on his number one uniform. he looked pale but determined. in fact, his face looked strangely expressionless. lad's scared stiff, gaunt thought. and no wonder. he nodded to caffran and the young man made a very brief, nervous response, a little tilt of his chin. there was something odd about caffran, and it took a moment for gaunt to realise it was the fact that the boy still had thick hair. locked away, he'd missed the shearing and fumigation. gaunt smiled to himself wryly, feeling the itch of his own fresh-shaved scalp. del mar cleared his throat. the clerk rose again. gaunt? lord, no one, not even caffran himself, denies that he was present in the area that night. furthermore, caffran admits seeing and speaking with the victim and her family. he remembers escorting her to her home and making sure she was settled. the prosecution depends squarely on the identification made by the victim's son. the boy is very young. given the terrible stress suffered by all cirenholmers during the occupation, and adding to that the ghastly death of his mother, he is deeply, pitifully traumatised. he may easily have identified the wrong man. he had seen caffran close up during the rehousing. when asked to pick out a tanith trooper, he chose caffran because he was the only one whose face he clearly recognised. i move we drop the charge and release trooper caffran. the real killer is yet to be prosecuted. lord commissar. gaunt expects us to believe this bright intelligent boy would forget the face of his mother's killer, and simply recall the face of a soldier who helped them briefly earlier the same night. we really are wasting time. a mass of circumstantial evidence points to trooper caffran, and the positive id clinches it. the defence can offer nothing, i repeat nothing substantial in the way of evidence to contradict the prosecution's case. just this whimsical theory of trauma-related mistaken identity. del mar waved fultingo back into his seat and looked at gaunt. gaunt stood up again. the door at the back of the room opened suddenly and hark hurried in. as quietly as possible, he took his seat next to gaunt. mr. del mar had been scribbling a few notes. he put the holo-quill back in its power-well. he said he thought they might have the wrong man. when he showed me this lad's picture, i knew he was right. you hadn't caught the killer at all. i came forward today so that justice would not let this young man down. and because i was afraid again. del mar held up a hand. thanks for your efforts, both of you. beltayn, take caffran back to the billet and see he has a good meal and a tot of sacra. give him and criid twelve-hour liberty passes too. gaunt faced hark. hark saluted and made his way over to the old man. gaunt caught his arm as he began to move away. daur shrugged. first of all, i thought you'd like to know that caffran was cleared of all charges this morning. next thing. more important to you. the time's come to tell you a little more about operation larisel. you've worked out by now that it's going to involve a grav-drop. in about a week, the taskforce will begin its assault on ouranberg. the strength of resistance will depend on the morale and spirit of the blood pact and their allied units. at the moment, that's very high. unbreakably high, perhaps. gaunt lifted a bulky weapon from the crate. it was an autorifle, almost a small cannon, with a heavy gauge barrel and a folding skeleton stock. he slapped a fat drum magazine into the slot behind the gnurled metal of the foregrip. for three days, supply barges from hessenville had been arriving to dock in the hangars along cirenholm's skirts. those that arrived under escort on the morning of the 221st were accompanied by the drogue skyro, carrying two urdeshi and one krassian regiment to bolster the invasion forces. many of the barges had been lugging aerial ordnance and parts to strengthen the taskforce's air wing, along with some eighteen marauders and twenty-seven lightnings. since the afternoon of the 215th, the strike wings had been flying sorties north of cirenholm to wrest air superiority from the ouranberg squadrons, and now long-range night raids had begun on the city itself. the effect of the bombing raids was difficult to judge. in three nights of missions over three hundred thousand tonnes of explosives were dropped on ouranberg at a cost of four marauders. the fighter sorties were somewhat easier to evaluate. unless scrambled to meet a detected raid, which were few and far between, the lightnings went up in four-ship patrols, hunting enemy traffic as directed by sky command cirenholm's modar, astrotachographic and long range auspex arrays.  twentynine enemy planes of varying types were claimed as kills during the first five days, for a loss of two lightnings. on the afternoon of the 220th, four wings of phantine lightnings were rushed up to intercept a mass raid by fifty enemy dive bombers and escort fighters. eight more lightnings and six marauders were fast-tracked up to join them as the battle commenced. the northern perimeter guns of cirenholm blistered the cloud cover with flak. the engagement lasted forty-eight minutes and was punishingly hardfought. the enemy was utterly routed before they could land a single item of munitions on cirenholm. they lost a confirmed tally of thirty-three planes. the phantine lost six, including the decorated ace erwell costary. flight lieutenant larice asch personally shot down four enemy aircraft, raising her career score to make her one of the few female phantine aces, and pilot officer febos nicarde succeeded in notching up seven kills. ornoff awarded him the silver aquila. it took hours for the twisted contrails and exhaust plumes created by the vast air battle to dissipate. inside the cirenholm hangars, munitorium workers, imperial guardsmen and volunteer citizens alike toiled in shifts to unload, process and store the vast influx of material. some of the hessenville barges also brought food and medicae supplies for the wounded population. mid-afternoon on the 221st, just about the time caffran was being discharged, five platoons of ghosts under the supervision of the munitorium were off-loading crates from a barge's cargo hold and wheeling them on trolleys through to a sub-hangar. rawne had put his adjutant feygor in charge, partly to ensure that the ghosts got the pick of the inventory for their support weapons and rocket launchers. the air was a racket of clattering carts, raised voices, whirring hoists and rattling machine tools. the ghosts were stripped to their vests, sweating hard to heft the laden trolleys up through the arch of the sub-hangar and then riding them back down the ramp empty with whoops and laughs. the sub-hangar was beginning to look like a mad warlord's pipe dream. across the wide floor, rows of ammo crates and munition pods alternated with rows of carefully lined-up rockets. along one wall, rack-carts with thick, meaty tyres carried fresh-painted bombs and missiles destined for underwing mounting. others had drawn on fanged mouths, turning the missiles into snarling predators. feygor nodded. oh, feth� derin hurried off. fifty metres down the back corridor from them, another hatch opened off the sub-hangar. two of them turned. feygor didn't recognise either of them. and feygor prided himself on knowing every face in the regiment. feygor cried out and pulled brostin into the wall as the shots blistered past them. polio had been a nobleman's bodyguard back on verghast, a trained warrior of house anko. expensive neural implants, paid for by his lord, gave him a reaction time significantly shorter than that of unaugmented humans. with a graceful sweep that combined instinct and immaculate training, he drew an autopistol from his thigh pocket and returned fire, placing his body without thinking between the assailants and his comrades. he dropped the shooter with a headshot. feygor bellowed. he was on his feet, his laspistol ripped from its holster. brostin had wrenched a fire-axe from a wall bracket. the sub-hangar behind them erupted in commotion. they burst into the stairwell and heard feet clattering on the steps below. feygor took the stairs three at a time, with polio close on his heels and brostin lumbering after. feygor threw himself against the banister and fired down the airspace. two hard-round shots ricocheted back up at him. they heard a door crash open. the lower door led into a service area, a wide machine shop that seemed menacingly quiet and dark, and which glistened with oil. feygor charged through the door and was almost killed by the gunman who had ducked back to lie in wait behind the hatch. two bullets hissed past the back of his head and made him stumble. a moment later, brostin came out of the door and pinned the gunman to the wall with one splintered whack of the fire-axe. shots rattled back across the machine shop. feygor spotted one muzzle flash in the semi-gloom, dropped on one knee and fired his laspistol from a double-handed brace. the target lurched back against a workbench and fell on his face. there was no sign of the third one. polio and feygor prowled forward. both swung around as they heard a door squeak. for a moment a figure was framed against the light outside. polio's handgun roared and the figure flew out of sight as if yanked by a rope. brostin found the machine shop lights. polio checked that the man he'd hit at the door was dead, and returned to find feygor rolling his kill over on the oily floor. there was no mistaking the man's grizzled face, or his hands, thick with old scars. the ghost uniform didn't even fit him particularly well. but it was a ghost uniform.  right down to the straight silver warknife in his belt case. he knelt down. near to the bloody hole feygor had put through the corpse, the black tanith tunic had another rent, a scorched puncture that had been hastily sewn up with back thread. six half-decent food was an understandable rarity on cirenholm, but the late lunch placed in front of gaunt and zweil looked surprisingly inviting. beltayn blushed. this act alone will get you into heaven. captain. pull up a chair and pour yourself a drink. gaunt realised where this was heading. the realisation stunned him. he looked at daur. doesn't cuu deserve that kind of loyalty too? he's a verghastite? tell that to all the verghastites in this regiment tomorrow when cuu goes to the wall. the old father shrugged. maybe. if you're expecting me to confirm or deny that on the basis of confession, forget it. i am a sponge for secrets, for the good of men's souls, but i do not leak. otherwise men would not trust me. what? it's often thought you are. zweil shrugged. gaunt turned round slowly. zweil toasted gaunt and drained his glass. i have to fight for cuu's life. lubba, the squad's flamer operator, was a short, thick-set man covered in underhive tattoos. lubba sat back and closed his eyes. there was a stillness for a moment, broken only by skerral's distant yells. for the first time, kolea felt the mood. the feeling that gnawed at the verghastites. the feeling they were second-class. he'd never sensed it before. he'd always got nothing but respect from gaunt. kolea asked, pausing by her. kolea said. got a minute? got me. okay. fair enough. varl� amongst others, i think� believes you're taking unnecessary risks. they think it's because you've lost your wife and kids, and that you're looking for a� what was it? poems. he looked down at the book with a little shake of the head. there was a moment. during the assault. i ran into the gunfire. i� i didn't care. and i like a glass of sacra now and then. he laughed, partly at her frank remark and partly at the way her verghastite accent made the tanith curse sound. she was one of the few from vervunhive who had cheerfully borrowed that other world's oath. well, there's no escape, is there? drink, narcotics � they must only make it worse. the hell of having your kids so near and yet so far away. for you, it must seem like there's only one escape. oh. i hadn't noticed that. seven at 08.00 imperial on the morning of the 222nd, the ghosts assigned to operation larisel met in an office annexe off the training sub-hangar. they had exercised, showered and eaten a good breakfast brought in from the billet kitchens. there was a tension in the air, but it was a fine-tuned, taut feeling of readiness and an eagerness to get on and do. when captain daur arrived, everyone was surprised to see him. asked mkoll. adare called out daur ignored him. the phantine troopers took their seats amongst the ghosts. daur keyed a stud on the desk and a large hololithic image of the target city rose majestically into being above the optical emitters. a threedimensional landscape, covering the table top. they all craned forward. several men laughed. asked larkin. the main porta, anyway. a sixty metre square vacuum hatch called ourangate. in front of it, extending out on an apron of rock for about a kilometre, give or take, is pavia fields, a kind of ornamental platform. standing stones. gaunt said. he stepped up onto the platform and walked to the empty row of seats on the defence side. gaunt walked over to him and lent down on the table. he said simply. they had acquired several sets of tanith fatigues and these knives. they were using defaced coinage to bribe the locals. del mar sat back, shaking his head. hark fell into step with him as they descended into the yard. gaunt glanced at him. hark's eyes darkened. hark looked away. hark nodded. gaunt got into his car and was driven away out through the gate. gaunt stepped up onto an empty ammo crate that beltayn had lugged in. as he got off the box and put his cap back on, gaunt thought about the information he hadn't been at liberty to announce. by the time the invasion began, the squads of operation larisel would have been active in ouranberg for over twenty-four hours. god-emperor willing. �trooper larkin, 2nd team marksman, tanith first just after midnight, in the first hour of the 224th, scald-storms rose cyclonically in the cloud oceans north of cirenholm. jarring, superheated belts of fire, dozens of kilometres long, crackled up into the higher reaches of the sky, and the borealis flickered and roiled in queasy, phantom coils. air visibility and sensor ranges were cut to less than five kilometres. plumes of rising ash blotted out the stars. the poisonous heart of phantine raged against the night. the storms had been predicted by the navy's long-range auspex, and the twitching senses of the taskforce astropaths. this was what the tacticians had been waiting for. the drogues zephyr and trenchant had reached their holding position several hours before midnight. hugging a dense reef of altocumulus cloud forty kilometres across, they kept station in a shallow gulf of sky called the leaward races, almost in the dead centre of the great air desert known as the western continental reaches. on the flight deck of the zephyr, admiral ornoff ordered the launch. ornoff had used the drogues judiciously to pursue his policy of nightly raids. by releasing the bomber shoals from carriers that varied their positions , he ensured that the defences of ouranberg never knew from which direction to expect the next raid. enemy hunter squadrons searched for the drogues by day, hoping to surprise them before they could unleash their armadas, but the western continental reaches were vast, and ornoff used the mammatocumulus of the regular scald-storms as cover. the night raid of the 224th would approach ouranberg from the south-east covering a distance to the target of about three hundred and forty kilometres. they would use the prevailing jet streams of the reaches to maximise speed, hugging the ultra-violet void where the troposphere became the stratosphere. including the fighter escort of imperial navy lightnings and thunderbolts, the raiding force numbered some six hundred aircraft. thirty matt-grey marauders of the phantine air corps took the role of the pathfinders, pressing ahead clear of the main formation to light up the target with illumination-mines and incendiary payloads. six minutes behind them came a mass wave of over three hundred heavy bombers. most of these were lumbering, six-engined magogs, painted an unreflective black. the magog was a prop-driven, atmospheric type that had been in service for centuries, but the wave also included two dozen behemoths, the awesome and ancient giants of phantine bomber command. following the first wave came a second pack of marauders, from either imperial navy or urdeshi regimental squadrons. the green mottle-camo of the former distinguished them from the silver-belly/beige-top two-tone of the latter. all seventy of them were laden with fuel-air explosive payloads. the third wave numbered almost two hundred craft. more magogs, as well as twenty urdeshi marauder destroyers and thirty phantine shrikes.  these destroyers, and the elderly hook-winged, single-engined shrike jets, were specialist dive bombers that would finish the raid by carrying out pinpoint low-level runs into a target zone that, by then, should have been grievously punished. flying as part of the second wave were four void-blue phantine marauders that carried no bombs at all. larisel 1, 2, 3 and 4. kersherin and the other skyborne specialists checked the ghosts over one by one, covering every detail down to boot laces and pocket studs with what would have seemed like obsessive fuss had the tension not been so high. each member of the larisel teams wore a modified version of their standard tanith uniform. in place of regulation underwear, they had been issued silk-lined, rubberised body-gloves that acted both as insulation against the extreme cold and a seal against the corrosive atmosphere. over that went the black tanith tunic, breeches and webbing, and over that a zip-up leather jump-smock that came down to the hips and was laced with chainmail. light equipment that would normally have been carried in a kit bag or backpack was distributed into the uniform pockets of the tunic and the webbing pouches and the smock closed up tightly over the top. gloves and boots were then pulled on, and gaiters buckled around the wrists and boottops to form a tight seal. by then, the ghosts were already sweating in the hot and abnormally heavy gear. they raised their arms as light belts-and-braces of outer webbing were fitted. these had pouches at the hips for additional kit items, and secure loops for lamp packs, flares, a rope-coil, a short-nose laspistol, a saw-edged cutting knife and the tanith blade. their camo-cloaks were tightly wound with a scrim-net around a pack of tube charges and grenades, and stuffed into a musette bag that was lashed horizontally from the front of the outer webbing across the groin. medi-packs, bag-rations and power-cells for the lasrifles and pistols were loaded into the troopers' thigh pouches. not everyone was carrying a lasrifle. apart from the four snipers with their long-las variants earned in covers with slings, milo, cocoer, meryn and varl had the u90 cannons. the solid ammunition took up a lot more space, so while the four of them carried spare cells in their thigh pouches for the other team members' guns, every member of the squad was strung with a bandolier of drum magazines. for the drop, the four u90's had slim, twenty-five round clips fitted and wrapped into place with adhesive tape. the higher capacity drum-mags they all carried in their bandoliers were too bulky to jump with. the cannons, like the lasrifles, had their muzzles plugged with wax stoppers to prevent them fouling on impact. camo paint was applied to their faces, and micro-beads fitted into their ears and tested. then they pulled on their woollen hats and did up their smock collars ready for the helmets. varl kissed the silver aquila that hung on a chain around his neck before dropping it down into his tunic and buckling up the neck of the over-jacket. the helmets were black steel with integral visors. inside, they had a leather liner-cap that buckled in place around the chin. a canvas frill around the bottom of the helmet tucked inside the smock collar and sealed with a zip. a pressurised air-bottle, which hooked to the chest webbing, would feed oxygen into the helmet cavity during the jump. finally, the jump-packs were lifted onto their backs, strapped on, and the power engaged for a final check. main weapons were cinched right across their chests. safeties were double-checked. kersherin offered up a brief but heartfelt prayer for them all. they could see little, and hear even less, except the crackle of the vox. it was hard to walk under the weight, and they shuffled around, smacking hands with each other awkwardly for good luck. milo heard adare moan. it made sense. he looked round at the cabin and saw that the other members of 1st team � banda, vadim and bonin � were listening in and looking with interest. unterrio raised a gloved paw and pointed to spots on the plate. actually, i'm fething scared, sarge. he heard rilke laugh. the marauder lurched badly again, the fifth or sixth time it had done so during the flight. the others didn't seem to be noticing the jolts anymore, but bonin was convinced it wasn't turbulence. the acute wariness that mkoll had trained into bonin and all the tanith scouts was ringing all sorts of alarms in his head. he got up, slowly, heavily, and thumped forward to the short rungs that led up into the cockpit. unterrio was hunched over the pict-plate with varl and he looked up as bonin shuffled past, unhappy that he was moving around but not about to stop him. bonin peered up at the flight crew. she didn't answer. the shoal's luck lasted until they were almost in sight of ouranberg. about ten kilometres out, the scald-storm suddenly collapsed and faded, sinking its fires into the lower stratum and leaving the air bare and empty. the ouranberg defences picked them up almost immediately. the fighters were on them about two minutes later. the cloud-hunters went through the shoal on afterburner, crossing north/south. two stricken magogs, on fire, ploughed their way down on steep dives into the scald. a navy marauder ceased to be in a blizzard of shrapnel and ignited gas. as the enemy craft banked round for another pass, they met the imperial fighter escort. through the cabin's slit window, milo could see streams of tracers and bright flashes flickering against the clouds. a brilliant light suddenly shone back through the cockpit, shafting down into the cabin. asked adare. babbist ushered cocoer and rilke up to the hatch. the dz's for larisel had been selected carefully. larisel 1, varl's mob, was to drop onto the main vapour mills, with larisel 4, under mkoll's command, dropping on the mill worker hab-domes to the north-west adare's unit, larisel 3, was going after the secondary vapour mills, and larisel 2, under meryn's control, was jumping on beta dome. flak whickered up at them from the city. the first wave of magogs had hammered beta dome. patterns of throbbing fire pulsed below: pin-points or clusters. white-hot fires raged up into the night and secondary explosions rippled through the domes. milo leapt from the marauder. he was instantly struck by a fierce sideways force, a hammerblow of slipstream that turned him over and over. he tumbled, stunned, and fell, gunning his pack. nothing seemed to happen. ouranberg was coming up very fast and very hard. milo yanked at his thruster control. training had been all well and good, but nothing could have prepared him for leaping into space in this kind of cross-wind. he was being swept clear of the dz. milo saw nessa and adare dropping past him, spread-eagled, trimming their thrusters. he slid in behind them, the wind tearing at his mask. the vast, dull-grey dome of the secondary mill rose up in front of him, a small city in its own right. he coasted in. larkin passed out as he left the hatch. it was partly fear, and partly the sledgehammer thump of the wind. move it! you've both got chutes! jagdea pushed him back. there was a bright burst right outside the cockpit dome and flak sent ribbons of metal and glass spearing in at them. asked mkoll. babbist yelled, struggling to get the flickering, rolling image to freeze. mkoll cried. a shower of sparks blinded him. more tracer was riddling the cabin, ripping through the hull-skin. varl landed a damn sight harder than he might have wished, and lay for a moment on a section of reinforced roof plating, winded and bruised. they were on a wide manufactory roof structure adjoining the main vapour mill, high up above ouranberg with only the mill chimneys and the crag of ouranpeak rising above them. the sky was a bright fury, but the raid now seemed far away. banda had made it down on a roof section adjacent to theirs, and as they went down to join her, using the lift of the packs to bounce themselves along as if on springs, they heard vadim calling urgently over the vox. unterrio spotted the young verghastite up on the inspection walkway of a chimney flue. varl looked. he wasn't sure what he was looking for, then he saw what vadim's sharp eyes had already detected. a marauder, about a kilometre and half away, turning south in a loop. it had to be mkoll's bird, larisel 4, making its pass on the mining habs. adare raised his gloved hand and exchanged palm-slaps with doyl, milo and nessa. cardinale hesitated and then smacked his own hand against adare's proffered gauntlet. milo knew adare was trying to make sure the phantine felt like part of the team. in truth, milo had returned adare's palm-slap with little conviction himself. the loss of mkoll was a profound shock. the scout sergeant had always seemed invulnerable, one of those ghosts who would never fall. milo even felt a little envious of nessa. she couldn't read their lips because of the visors and no one had signed her the news. he'd been worried about how she might cope with the mission given her disability, but now it seemed she was lucky to be spared the bad news. at least for a while. doyl led them down the length of the ventilator stack and then across a narrow open space to the cover of some galvanised pipework. they moved sluggishly and heavily, even though the grav-units of their jump-packs were still on to ease the burden. cardinale helped doyl out of his jump pack and the scout hurried on alone, looking for an entry point while the others got rid of their packs. adare and cardinale stowed the heavy units in a stack under the pipework, lashed them in place with rope and concealed them with a scrim net. milo doubted there would be many foot patrols up here in the toxic atmosphere outside the dome, but the last thing they wanted was for the enemy to find traces of a troop landing. they were still weighed down with kit, helmets and the armoured smocks, but now they felt a thousand times lighter. nessa had taken her long-las out of its cover and assembled it, though with her visor in place, there was no point aligning the scope. milo peeled the adhesive tape off his u90's twenty-five round clip and replaced it with a drum magazine marked with a red cross � the special armour-piercing load. adare collected in and pocketed the plastic muzzle stoppers. then he gently tried his vox-link. they'd picked up varl's strangled message whilst still in the air. now they were down, the hard structures of ouranberg were blocking anything but short-range transmission. as daur had predicted in his last briefing, there was going to be no contact between teams once the mission was underway. a full-gain vox-caster would have weighed one of them down unnecessarily. besides, it wasn't impossible that the enemy was scanning for vox-calls on the known imperial wavelengths. milo hunched down so that he had a good firing position, covering the space all the way from the pipework to what looked like a row of short exhaust flues on the edge of the roof section. despite the bitter cold, he was hot, and he could feel cold sweat running down his spine. it was getting harder to breath. they were probably reaching the limit of their air-bottles. doyl reappeared. he had unshipped his camo-cloak and shrouded himself with it. doyl took out a compact cutting torch, said the prayer of ignition, lit its small energy blade and sliced into the lock. there were a few sparks and a slight glow, but adare held his camo-cloak out to screen the work. once the teeth of the lock were cut doyl used his knife to force the corroded hatch out of its frame adare led the way in, a lamp pack locked to his lasrifle's bayonet lug. the chamber appeared to be a circulation space around the head of an elevator assembly. heavy machinery, caked in grease, jutted up out of the floor. even with his helmet on, milo could hear the wind moaning through rust holes in the metal roof-cover. doyl located a floor hatch in the far corner and they snuggled down a short ladder into dark attic spaces that filled the cavity between the mill's outer roof and inner pressurised hull. it was now getting very hard to breathe. the floor beneath them was a skin of clean metal ribbed with tension members. unwilling to find out if the inner hull skin was load-bearing, they edged along the ribbing. after about fifty metres, they came across a break in the inner roof where rockcrete support piles of staggering proportions rose through to buttress the main roof. one had metal rungs fused into the side, and they descended again, carefully, hand over hand, weapons slung on their backs. twenty metres down, the way was blocked. a huge moulded collar of industrial plastene sheathed the descending piles and sealed them against the downward sloping rim of roof-skin. adare believed they would have to go back, but milo spotted an almost invisible inspection plate in the metal skin. with adare supporting his weight, doyl leaned out from the rungs and pressed against the plate until it fell into the cavity behind. doyl swung over and clambered through. a moment later, he voxed them to follow. they were in a crawl space under the inner skin, and there was barely room to stand. doyl replaced the plate which had rubberised edging and formed a seal by being held in place by the internal pressure. milo could feel the rush of air going out past him until doyl got the plate back in position. gratefully, they unplugged their air-tubes and slid their visors up. the air was thin and cold and had a rough taste in it that stung their throats. but they were now inside the pressurised section of the mill. cardinale asked. they hunched their way down the crawl space. it opened out dramatically, stretching out further than the eye could see, but didn't get any deeper. doyl scouted around, and found a hatch in the floor some forty metres off. it was heavy-duty, imperial design, and electronically locked. the scout worked fast. he taped one of the six miniature circuit-breakers he carried in his tool-roll to the hatch frame, and secured its leads to either side of the lock. he waited until the little green rune on its casing lit up, indicating that the hatch's alarm circuit was now looping via the breaker, and then cut through the lock-tongue with his cutting torch. though there was no immediate scream of klaxons, it was impossible to tell if the alarm had been bypassed, so they dropped through the hatch quickly and pulled it shut behind them. the hatch had let them down into a maintenance corridor, old and dingy, and poorly lit. centuries of condensation had rusted the walls, rotted the matboards and encouraged thick, lurid mould growths along the ceiling. south, the direction of the main city structure of ouranberg. and the creature they had come to kill. it had taken bonin a full ninety seconds to gain control of his jump-pack, and that had felt like an eternity: tumbling, wheeling, spinning, with no sense of up or down. somehow, jagdea had shown the good sense to cling on to him, despite the violence of their drop. she replied. below their dangling feet there was nothing but the frothing, fire-lit expanse of the scald. his voice over the link sounded tinny and dull. the night winds beat and tugged at them. cautiously, bonin nudged them towards the gloomy city, using little squirts of turbine power to buoy them along like a leaf on a racing stream. the crosswinds seemed to be with them, but every now and then, the gale suddenly gusted against them, and the pair were turned or blown back. varl! banda! vadim! bonin voxed. foolishly, he had imagined his biggest problem was going to be getting anywhere near the mill. now, seeing the size of it, he realised that finding his team mates was going to be a much taller order. he repeated his calls as often as he dared. they soared down past a scaffolding tower structure that suddenly lit up and roared with heavy anti-air fire. they weren't the target. the tower was plugging away at a shrike divebomber that had misjudged its run. but bonin had been concentrating so hard on steering and guiding, he hadn't even thought about the defence points and towers ouranberg bristled with. it was a sudden, sobering thought. perhaps it was that they presented such a tiny target perhaps luck was with them, but it now seemed like a miracle that they hadn't been spotted, tracked and fired on by any of the gun emplacements on gamma dome. luck, bonin decided. he couldn't see it because of the high, covering cirrocumulus, but he was sure his lucky star was still up there somewhere. banda rose from cover on the upper roof as they clambered up. she nodded at jagdea. maybe now we're all finally here, we can get on. roofscape's crawling with bad guys. sergeant. i know i'm� not meant to be here. varl tightened the strap on his u90 thoughtfully. oh, feth. meryn's order was terse but necessary. kuren and kersherin opened fire and cut down the trio. it didn't feel right kuren thought. it didn't feel right at all, but they had to preserve their secrecy. another emergency worker appeared and started running towards the elevator at the end of the hall. he had abandoned a blast victim who lolled on a stretcher in the open doorway of a room. mkvenner fired and the worker slammed over against the wall, slid down, and lay for a moment drumming his feet against the deck before he died. mkvenner nodded and pulled out a couple of tube charges from his musette. larkin watched, still shaking. this ruthlessness was a side of corporal meryn he hadn't seen before. meryn, one of the younger ghosts, was an able and reliable soldier. his service record was excellent, but gaunt had not yet advanced him. rawne, however, had recently taken meryn under his wing. now, it seemed, he was aiming to prove himself, taking no chances that might vitiate successes for the mission. he was doing things the way his hard-arsed mentor rawne would do them. it wasn't the meryn larkin knew. said meryn, and they hurried down into the stairwell next to the elevator as tube charge blasts blew the hall out of the side of the dome above them. praise the warp! the warp is the one true way! the names of the warp are a billion and one, and each name is the lament of mankind! worship the warp! praise be the warp! through the power of the warp, the lord of change will transmute the galaxy! milo sensed nessa was shaking, and realised with an unexpected pang of fear that she was responding to the sounds even though she couldn't hear the words. he pushed her on through the crowd. he prayed to the god-emperor of mankind that the tannoy wouldn't utter that awful word again. cardinale had reached the gateway of the yard, where workers pressed in to approach the bascule. he tried to block out the sounds, his hand clamped so tight around his little silver aquila, the wingtips were puncturing his palm. he suddenly registered the pain, and flexed his hand. cardinale looked back, trying to find the other members of the team without raising his head. he spotted adare, and doyl. there was no sign of the boy or the female sniper. the gate joined the causeway via the bascule, a massive ironwork drawbridge lowered on thick chains from the winch house overhanging the drop. as its great bulk dropped down with a shuddering crash, blood pact slavers started to whip the workers into line. they opened the gate's barred shutter. an electro-lash caught the back of cardinale's calf and he fell to one knee as his leg spasmed. a nearby slaver roared, though his hoarse snarls were mainly directed at the workers who had been completely knocked down by the whip. cardinale felt a strong hand support his arm and he got to his feet. whips cracked and they spilled through onto the bascule and the causeway beyond. the causeway was a rockcrete thoroughfare broad enough to take a cargo track. it was roofed with pressurised, wire-reinforced glassite and lit by crude strip lamps buried in the walls. don't look round. milo and nessa are about twenty metres back. i saw them both. oh shit the slender chain was still wrapped around his hand, but it was broken. the silver aquila was gone. a slaver screamed now the transport had passed. the workers resumed their march over the causeway. cardinale said, rubbing at the wingtip punctures in his palm flesh. alarm! alarm! alarm! adare said. cardinale stammered. the trio elbowed their way through the milling workers, closing on the gateway. behind them, blood pact soldiers were surging out across the bascule onto the causeway, pushing aside mill workers, or simply gunning them down. there was a terrible howling. milo urged nessa, squeezing her arm. she said aloud. she dragged him back against the causeway wall amongst the cowering workers, and pulled his hood down over his head. nessa had fought the verghast hive war as a scratch company guerilla. she knew how to mingle in the ordinary, how to hide in plain sight.  though his gut instinct told him to run, milo remembered that, and trusted her. he bowed his head. blood pact troopers and slavers rushed past them, kicking down anyone foolish enough to get in their way. the hate-dogs, trailing ropes of drool, bounded ahead of them, baying, making the air stink with their rancid pelts. two confused mill workers were gunned down right in front of milo and nessa by the blood pact. their bodies lay crumpled in spreading lakes of blood, kicked and trampled by the chaos troopers who rushed after. inside the porta, alarms were also ringing. enemy troops, their iron masks glaring, were corralling all the slaves who had crossed the causeway to one side of the entrance hall. said adare as they came through the gateway, setting foot on ouranberg proper for the first time. the dogs! cardinale whined. doyl said as loudly as he dared. adare growled. cardinale yelled. he pushed adare aside. oh feth! no! don't! adare shouted. he blew three of them apart, two in mid-air. the fourth, a two hundred pound cyber-mastiff, barrelled into him and smashed him to the floor. sergeant adare wrenched out his lasrifle and blasted the dog off cardinale point-blank. doyl swept round and raked the nearby blood pact guards with his own rifle. cardinale was screaming. blood was pouring out of his torn neck. doyl yelled, shooting dead two more of the approaching dogpack. doyl cried. he blasted his weapon in a wide arc that toppled two blood pact sentries out of an autocannon nest overlooking the porta's entrance hall. the slaves were shrieking and running in panic. adare dragged cardinale to his feet and fired his lasrifle one-handed. doyl started cutting a desperate path for them through the frenetic mob. if they could get clear and just find somewhere to hide� doyl recoiled as a las-round creased his forehead. blood started to trickle into his eyes. cursing, he pulled out a tube charge, ripped off the det-tape and hurled it to his left. the concussive blast hurled three blood part infantrymen into the air and added to the wild confusion. firing indiscriminately at anything that looked like a chaos trooper, adare cut a swathe through the press towards the north-west exit of the entrance hall. he was virtually carrying cardinale by then. adare shouted. doyl, half-blinded by his own blood, followed adare's voice. he had to push and kick slaves out of his way. autocannon fire chopped into the crowd, and felled a dozen workers. doyl could smell fycelene and the metallic scent of blood. the cannon rattled again. wiping the back of his sleeve across his eyes, doyl turned back, dropped to one knee, and aimed at the source of the heavy fire. blood pact troopers were shooting their way through the pandemonium of slaves. one had a support cannon on a bipod, and a slaver ran beside him, feeding belts of ammunition. the jagged muzzle flashes of the cannon illuminated the gun's brutal work like a strobe light. each flare froze a snapshot of lurching figures, slaves falling, knocked off their feet, crashing into one another doyl managed to shoot the gunner through the throat before his wound blinded him again. adare had reached the north-east exit, and stumbled into the doorway, spilling cardinale over. adare screamed at doyl over the crump-whoosh of the grenade. together, they broke out into a wide stone tunnel leading off from the entrance hall. smoke from the main hall was blowing in and pooling under the arched roof. slaves were staggering, stunned, everywhere. cardinale! you hear me? you hear me? adare urged, trying to rise. okay, but we need to go to ground. said adare. he turned, his next words drowned by a buzzing roar. adare's chest exploded and he was slammed back against the wall with enough force to splinter bone. hundreds of tiny, secondary impacts simultaneously peppered the stonework. doyl staggered backwards, trying to shield cardinale. the phantine had collapsed again. doyl was sure cardinale was dead. the scout could suddenly smell an odour of rancid milk mixed with mint. the beast was moving so fast the tanith scout could barely follow it. using its dewclaws to grip the stones, it skittered along the tunnel roof, upside down. an armature frame of augmetic servo-limbs clamped around its torso automatically racked the xenos-pattern flechette blaster it had used to slay adare. a crude leather bandolier dangled from its gleaming, mottled body.  it gazed down its wattled snout at doyl, doubled han lids flickering across its milky eyes protectively. doyl raked it with las-fire. it barely flinched. doyl screamed and fired again. he emptied his size three clip into the beast until the power was gone. it grabbed him by the throat with one of its powerful fore-limbs and lifted him up. he gagged. the slavers raged, making free use of their goads and lashes. rounded up again, the slave details filed through into the entrance hall. the place was littered with debris and blood. heretic troopers were dragging corpses away. are they�? nessa signed. don't think about it, milo replied. it's down to us now. following the crowd, heads down, the two survivors of larisel 3 shuffled into the city. varl's team progressed steadily down through ouranberg's main vapour mill complex, following back stairs and sub-corridors. several times, they had to conceal themselves to avoid roaming patrols or hurrying work-gangs. bonin led the way. they'd ditched their extra jump kit, helmets and mail smocks, and the ghosts had put on their stealth-cloaks. varl had draped scrim-nets over unterrio and jagdea and smeared a little camo-paint on the pilot's face. from all directions, the mill rang with the sounds of heavy labour. drills chattered. hoists whirred. turbines rambled and shook. the tactical briefing had presumed slaith to be secure somewhere in alpha dome. varl considered it a priority to obtain more specific information. twice they stopped while unterrio tried patching his data-slate into a city-system terminal, but it was futile. slaith's forces had corrupted the imperial database and flooded it with incompatible, unreadable sequences. they crossed a series of storage halls, and skirted the edge of an airwharf. here, they had to wait in hiding for almost fifteen minutes while servitors loaded a cargo carrier. only when the carrier lifted off the pad and flew off in the direction of the alpha dome did the wharf clear, allowing them to continue. varl nodded. he glanced at jagdea. they pressed on, but the way was blocked. work-gangs under armed guard were clearing bomb damage from the next manufactory space. varl said. bonin hissed. he'd forced the lock on a side door. they hurried through and he closed it behind them. they were in a small storeroom for machine parts. it stank of oil-based lubricant. varl and bonin flanked the door, weapons ready, listening to the feet marching past outside. they could hear rough voices, and a series of vox-exchanges. several individuals had stopped to converse just outside the door. vadim pushed to the back of the store. he quietly cleared some plyboard boxes from a grubby bench and hoisted himself up to reach a small fan-light window high in the wall. the window was crazed with dirt, and he had to use his pry-bar to move the latch. looks promising, he signed. varl and the other ghosts nodded. jagdea and unterrio, unfamiliar with gestures, frowned. you first, i'll cover. get those three through and vadim after them, varl's hands wrote in the air deftly. bonin gave him a thumbs-up and went to the back of the room, taking vadim's place on the bench. he squinted through the fanlight and felt cool air on his face. the little window looked out onto a circulation space between mill houses. he wedged the window open as wide as it would go with his warknife, and slithered through head first. at the door, varl watched bonin's boots disappear. the voices outside were still arguing, but seemed to be moving away. bonin's face reappeared at the window and he reached an arm down. banda got up, pushed her long-las through the gap and hauled herself after it. vadim boosted her feet to help her on her way. he turned and waved jagdea up. with vadim pushing her feet, she was nimble enough, but the scrim-net varl had insisted she wear snagged on the edge of the window frame. she struggled, pinned. vadim got up on the bench next to her and tried to unhook the netting. his efforts shook the old bench and wobbled the tall, spares-laden shelving next to it. varl kept glancing back. hurry the feth up! he mouthed at vadim. he was sure the harsh voices outside were getting closer again. he flexed his augmetic shoulder and adjusted his grip on the heavy u90. vadim drew his warknife and slit through the net, freeing jagdea. she slithered out through the window, but the sudden motion of her release shook the bench again. vadim swayed, and the shelf rocked. a tin canister full of rivets dropped off the top shelf. varl saw it fall as if in slow motion. he closed his eyes, waiting for the inevitable. there was no sound. he looked again. unterrio had caught the canister a few centimetres from the rockcrete floor. the look of heart-stopped relief on the faces of vadim and unterrio almost made varl burst out laughing. unterrio exited next. in the light of jagdea's difficulties, he had the sense to take off his scrim-net and bundle it through the window ahead of him. vadim, crouching on the bench, looked back at varl and beckoned him. you go, varl mouthed. he looked back at the door and then pressed his ear to it. the voices were right outside now. right out fething side. bonin had broken the door lock to get them in, but varl noticed a bolt, which he gingerly drew into place. he backed slowly from the door, keeping his gun aimed at it. vadim was through the window. he leaned back in to pull varl up. keeping his gun on the door, varl sat on the bench and slowly drew his feet up. his left boot brushed the edge of the shelf. two litre-capacity flasks of lamp oil toppled and smashed on the storeroom floor. varl couldn't believe he'd been so stupid. he could hear the voices, and saw the latch being waggled furiously. vadim hissed. there was a hammering on the door now. kicking. shouting. then shots. the metal of the door around the latch deformed and burst under the impact of several las-rounds. the bolt still held. whoever was on the outside now opened fire directly at the door, punching six molten holes. vadim shouted. said varl. he was badly bruised on his shoulders and the backs of his legs from the hits. he got up, aimed his u90 at the door and opened fire, bracing against the recoil. his weapon was loaded with a clip of standard .45 calibre rounds. striking the metal door, they dented its surface wildly, but few penetrated. an answering storm of fire punished the door from the other side. varl popped the yellow-tagged drum out of his weapon, replaced it with a red, racked back the bolt, and blitzed the door with explosive armour piercing rounds. they went through the door like it was made of wet paper. the surrounding wall too.  the explosive bullets blew bricks and metal shreds out into the corridor. varl turned, tossed the gun up to vadim, and threw himself up through the fan-light. an alarm was ringing. it was quickly answered by another. larisel 1 dashed across the circulation space and towards a gulley that formed the waste-gutter for a small foundry. another gulley, but it was piled with precast tiles for roofing repairs. his sure-footed climbing skills exceeded theirs, but they followed, making it up to the top of a wall, and from there onto the pitched roof of a walkway cloister. they hid under the tarpaulin covers of a barrel stack in the next workyard. meryn's team, larisel 2, was the first to see the face of sagittar slaith. every street and plaza in beta dome had its public address screens and pict-plates tuned to a mesmerisingly grim live feed of various blood pact preachers gibbering blasphemies and extolling the virtues of their daemonic faith. the broadcasts were constant and relentless, captured by a fuzzy, handheld viewer that regularly went out of focus trying to remain trained on the capering, lunging hierarchs. they were painted, pierced devils, ranting in a mix of their own warp-twisted language and bastardised low gothic. some would preach for hours at a time, twitching and spasming as if they were thrashing through narcotic highs. others would scream hysterically for a few short minutes before disappearing. the pict image would then jump and flicker as it cut to the next preacher. the members of larisel 2 tried to ignore the broadcasts, but they were pretty much inescapable. they echoed and rang around every street and access tunnel. of the team, larkin was the most disturbed by the transmissions. on the way down through the bombed sections of the upper habs, they had ditched their jump kit and, freed of the visored helmet, larkin had at last been able to take some of his powerful anticonvulsants. he felt better for a while, but the migraine itself merely subsided. it kept rumbling around the edges of his brain like a storm that refused to break. once they got into the primary sector levels, there was a pict-address plate on every other corner. larisel 2 hugged back streets, sub-walkways and deserted yards, but there was no respite from the blaring voices and jerking pictures. larkin felt his stress levels soaring, and the migraine began to boil up again. the comprehensible, low gothic parts of the sermons were bad. the speech used, the concepts, the ideas, were all hard to take and often shocking. but the gabbled warp-words were much worse, as far as larkin was concerned. his mind knotted as it imagined the meanings. worst of all, what really chilled larkin, was the sight of ouranberg citizens, ragged, often weeping, watching the broadcasts. they seemed to be under no duress. they simply stood at street corners, in squares and wide commercial parades, gazing at the screens, their minds gradually corroding under the poisonous bombardment of warp-lies. mkvenner steered them well. he had an unerring instinct for avoiding foot patrols, and swept them into cover each time a speeder went over. they stayed out of sight of crowds, and only once had to silence an individual who spotted them. a middle-aged man had simply walked out into a yard as they were sprinting across it. he had stared at them without saying a word and then just turned and wandered back into his hab. meryn had broken from the group and followed the man into the building. a few minutes later, he re-emerged and they moved on. no one asked meryn what he'd done. everyone knew. everyone knew it was absolutely paramount to maintain the mission's secrecy for as long as possible. it was a necessary evil. just like shooting the rescue crews. a necessary evil. and there was quite enough unnecessary evil in the fething galaxy without deliberately adding to it. on balance, what he really didn't like was the fact that meryn showed no emotion. he remained calm, unexpressive. probably a quality rawne, maybe even gaunt, would admire as utterly professional devotion to duty. but larkin thought that he might feel easier about stuff if meryn showed just one ounce of regret or upset. just before dawn on the 224th, they stopped for a rest break, taking shelter on the first floor of an abandoned weaver's. once the day cycle started, movement would be restricted, and they needed to get some bag-rations inside them and catch some sleep. the weaver's premises, which had been looted and then boarded up, overlooked a small municipal square full of burned-out vehicles and litters of debris. a public-address screen on the opposite side of the square boomed out the latest tirade of slaith's preachers. citizens stood around oil can fires gazing at the broadcast. they ate, then kuren took the first watch. he woke them all after about two hours. it was still dark outside. the lamps that should have cut in automatically at the start of the day cycle had been shot out. ouranberg seemed to be locked into a permanent twilight, which mkvenner realised would help their progress immensely. kuren had woken them because of the broadcasts. the preachers had shut up, and a good fifteen minutes had gone by with nothing on the screen but white noise. then sagittar slaith had appeared. he was utterly terrifying. they had been shown a few blurry longshots of a being believed to be slaith during the premission briefings, vague suggestions of someone tall and heavy-set but nothing that could be called a likeness. the face on the screen was entirely hairless: bald, shaven, lacking even eyebrows and lashes. his ears were grossly distended by the weight and number of the studs and rings that pierced them. they looked like a lizard's frill. slaith's teeth were chrome triangles, like the tips of daggers. three huge and old diagonal scars marked each cheek, ritual cuts made to seal his pact with urlock gaur. he wore a white fur cloak over a spiked suit of maroon power-armour. his eyes were pupil-less white slits. his voice was the soft, muffled throb of a nightmare that had woken the sleeper in terror with no clear memory of why he was afraid. he spoke to them. directly to them. stammered larkin. meryn shushed him. his eyes never blinked. give up your futile mission now, and i will grant you the mercy of a quick death. the screen fuzzed and rolled for a long while. they all jumped as another preacher suddenly appeared, howling out a stream of profanities. larkin's hands were shaking badly. his mouth was dry. maybe. larkin? the stacks of ouranberg's waste gas burners lay out to the north and west of the city, built up on slender crags of rock. heavy pipelines carried by vast trestle frames of ironwork girders, some over four kilometres long, linked them to the main city structure. the burners themselves were fat kiln-like brick chimneys twenty metres in diameter, capped with blackened-metal ignition frames. it was mid-morning on the 224th. the sky was a blinding bowl of topaz altostratus and the morning pollution banks welling up from the scald were dissolving into yellowish vapours as the headwind gathered force. ominous clouds gathered in the western distances. ouranberg was three kilometres away at the end of a vast span of rusty girderwork. the dry was still immense. sunlight flared and glinted off its ribbons of windows. thin black smoke, like smudged thumbprints, rose from the domes. out of breath from the last stint of climbing, he sat back on a thin ledge of rock about fifty metres from the top of the stack, one boot braced to stop the wind sweeping him off. the burner high above him hummed as the wind blew through the cavities of its burner brackets and every ten minutes or so there was a gigantic whoosh as gas ignited and blistered up into the sky. cinders floated down like snowflakes. his air bottle had long since been spent, and he was forced to use the helmet's rudimentary rebreather that meant every lungful came in moist and warm, and it was impossible to breathe deeply. this was a climb that would have been hard even in clean air conditions. he'd sweated off about two kilos already. his head ached from oxygen starvation. his hands and knees and feet, despite gloves, reinforced leggings and boots, were bloody and raw. he started to climb again, and managed about ten metres. that put him almost on a level with the bottom spars of the pipeline's scaffold. he lifted his visor quickly to suck water from his flask, and then lowered it. the temptation to inhale the cold air outside was almost overwhelming. he clambered to the edge of the scaffolding. it had looked slender from a distance, but now he was up close , he appreciated the titanic scale of the ibeams and girder spars. climbing it wouldn't be easy. the spars were far too wide apart. he would have to belly along the girders, hand over hand. and reach ouranberg sometime next century. the alternative was to keep climbing and cross the bridge along the pipeline. that meant going vertically up the increasingly sheer rock stack for another forty metres or so. he tested the tension on the rope that played out beneath him. there wasn't much give, so he spent ten minutes hoisting the kit up to his level. climbing with full kit on would have been out of the question. he'd been forced to lash it together and drag it up after him every rime he reached the limit of the rope. if only his jump-pack hadn't been crippled in the drop. he keyed his micro-bead and tried another call. still nothing. he knew he was well out of range but still he couldn't resist trying every now and then. soric's one good eye was bleary. he'd been unconscious for many days. given the extent of his chest wound, dorden wasn't sure how he was managing to remain alive divorced from the life support apparatus. it's me, agun. what's with the weapon? dorden hesitated. he remembered, with an unnerving clarity, sergeant varl saying the same thing. i know. i dreamt it. but the daemon rats. they don't know. they're chewing at him. daemons? more daemons? placated dorden. curth ordered, herding the bystanders out. she drew the screen behind them and looked back at dorden. vervun smeltery one, man and boy, ahh. hardens you up, it does, smeltery work. she's a lovely girl, isn't she, doc? soric looked at her. feth! he's respiring on both lungs! no� there's a fluid mass. but not much. curth and dorden both hesitated. curth asked. soric spluttered. clear as you like his voice was distant now, as if he had exhausted himself. curth glanced at dorden. she saw the look in his eyes. curth yelled. by the time gaunt reached the infirmary, soric was strapped into a cot and back on life support. gaunt stood with curth in the shadows of a service doorway down the hall from the intensive bay. curth was trying to light a lho-stick, her hands unsteady. he walked over to a flamer pack that had been dumped amidst a clumsy pile of kit along the corridor wall by crash crews and lit the thing off a blue pilot flame from the nozzle. he crossed back to curth and handed her the lho-stick. the ghosts in the main billet were packing kits and stripping down weapons when hark brought the punishment detail back in. trooper cuu was cuffed and hobbled, and scurried to keep up with the guards. his face was drawn and pale from too many nights in a cell, and it made his jagged scar all the more prominent. the nearest trooper handed him a fob of geno-keys and the commissar unlocked cuu's restraints. cuu stood blinking, rubbing his wrists. hark snarled, pushing his face into cuu's. hark looked away. the detail turned on their heels and marched out, hark behind them. cuu crossed to his cot. four it was a long way down. the late afternoon was bringing down a glowering weather pattern: low, dark nimbostratus swollen with rain and a stiff westerly wind. in sympathy, the scald far below was seething up, churning with firestorms and electrochemical flares. the driving acid rain was heavy enough to reduce ouranberg to little more than a grey blur against the ominous sky. but it did little to reduce the scale of the yawning gulf beneath him. mkoll edged along the top of the pipeline. there was just enough room on the girders of the support cradle for him to put one foot exactly in front of the next, steadying himself with one hand against the side of the pipe itself. the rain was making everything slick: the metal under his feet, the pipe under his touch. there wasn't much in the way of anything to actually grasp onto except the occasional rivet. it was a matter of steady balance and total concentration. for the first five hundred metres or so, he'd walked along the top of the great pipe, but then the weather had deteriorated and the rising wind had denied him that option. walking along the edge of the cradle was much slower going. he would have preferred not to look down, but it was essential. the girders were scabbed with rust and sticky lichens, and he had to place each step carefully. below him was a sheer drop down into the toxic depths of phantine. one slip, one patch of rust or moss, one rain-slick spar, and he would be falling without hope of survival. mkoll was pretty sure that if he fell, he would collide with one of the span's cross members on the way, so at least he wouldn't know much about it. he'd already had two close shaves. a sudden gust of updraft had nearly swept him off. and he'd accidentally trodden on one of the vile slug-like things that dwelt in this dismal place. thermovores. bonin and milo had told him about them. the thing had squished and his boot had slid right away in the slime. too close. too, too close. mkoll figured he was about halfway across. the rain was getting heavier, sheeting down diagonally, and barks of thunder shook the air. it was almost twilight, and, apart from a few lights, the city was now utterly invisible. the rain had brought the slugs out. mkoll presumed they derived nutrients from the precipitation, or essential fluids, or maybe fed on micro-algae dissolved out of the metal by the rain's high acidity. feth, he was no biologist! all he knew for sure was that the metalwork was covered with the disgusting things, ten times the number that had been there at the start of his crossing, before the rain. he tried not to touch them and certainly not to tread on them. the latter was difficult. he had to take long strides regularly to step over writhing piles of them. twice, he had to use the stock of his lasrifle to sweep particularly large masses out of his way. the skinwing presumably mistook him for a rival predator. or perhaps it fancied bigger game. he saw it coming right at the last minute, a scrawny, attenuated rat-like thing with a ragged, two metre wingspan and a whip-thin tail four metres long. it flew into his visored face, trilling ultrasonic squeals frenziedly, and beating its wings at him. mkoll stumbled, swung at it with a curse, and slipped off the girder. he caught the girder edge with his left hand. the impact of arrest nearly dislocated his shoulder. mkoll grunted in pain. his legs pinwheeled, trying to find something to tuck against. as his left fingertips began to slip off, he got his right hand on the girder too. his first grab came away with a handful of thermovores. he shook them off his fingers and got a better grip. his legs were still dangling and his forearms were on fire with the effort of gripping the spar and supporting his weight. she had difficulty gauging the volume of her own speech. sneaking away from the slave gang they had mingled with to cross the causeway, they had spent the earlier part of the day progressing across the main mill areas and work yards, avoiding the eagerly searching patrols of the enemy. in the middle part of the afternoon, weary from effort and the sustained tension, they had broken into a derelict tenement hab on the outskirts of alpha dome to steal a few hours' rest. neither of them had mentioned the terrible events of the causeway crossing. milo hadn't known doyl well, but he knew the ghosts had lost a valuable and gifted scout. adare's death affected him on a more direct emotional level. lhurn adare; sharp, confident and strong, had been a wellliked tanith and a personal friend. he had been one of colonel corbec's sacra-drinking cronies, a die-hard carouser who liked to see the dawn come up with the likes of varl, derin, cown, domor, bragg and brostin. part of the inner circle, the heart and backbone of the tanith first. milo had seen plenty of action at adare's side, right from the early days. he remembered the relentless practical jokes adare had played on baffels and cluggan. he remembered getting fabulously legless with him the night adare made sergeant. he remembered adare's frequent, sound advice. now they were both gone. adare and doyl. dead, milo was sure. like all the others. baffels, on hagia. cluggan, long gone on voltemand. mkoll, in the skies over ouranberg. how much longer, milo wondered, until all the last pieces of tanith were worn away? he got to his feet and stretched, trying to shake off the sadness so his mind could be sharp. the bare room was lit by a single chemical lamp that nessa had dared to ignite because the windows were boarded with sheets of pulpply. her long-las was laid out on her camo-cloak, disassembled. she was using a thimble sewn from vizzy-cloth to polish and oil the firing mechanism. milo took out some foil-sealed bag rations and wolfed them down, swigging water from his flask. he noticed his hands were grimed with dust, but didn't care. he opened the tissue paper schematic of ouranberg they had all been issued with and studied it again, plotting routes. a dream? we did it every day during the scratch fighting. milo shook his head, puzzled. she put down her long-las and faced him. it was a joke at first. a bad, dark joke. he could hear a knocking, scraping sound from the floor below.  seeing his look, nessa got up and loaded a cell magazine into her long-las. slowly, listening, milo lifted his cannon. more knocking, a crash. let's go, he signed. they gathered up their kit rapidly, keeping an eye on the door. nessa extinguished the lamp. in the sudden, blue gloom, milo gestured to the back door with his thumb, they moved slowly, silently towards it, weapons ready, camo-cloaks draped around them. milo gently pulled back the pulp-ply boarding the nearest window. three platoons of blood pact were assembling in the square outside. another search-patrol. ever since adare and doyl had been discovered, the enemy had been scouring the mill district for other imperial interlopers. milo and nessa backed to the rear door. they were expecting blood part. but it wasn't. the hab-room door splintered in, exploded by some powerful shotgun blast, and the first loxatl scurried through. in the half-light, milo got a glimpse of a sinuous, grey body with a flat, snouted head and a short, muscular tail. it came in and went up the wall, dewclaws ripped into the plaster to gather purchase. an augmetic limb-frame snapped around its mottled belly tracked around the pepper-pot nose of an alien scattergun. a second loxad slithered in through the door and clawed its way rapidly up the other wall. milo could smell spearmint mixed with sour milk. its bionic weapon-frame clicked around, sweeping the room. it aimed at milo, shooting out a dull green aiming light that splashed on his cloak. nessa's long-las roared. the second alien mercenary was ripped off the wall by the hot-shot and smashed, convulsing, into the doorframe. the other one fired its weapon. a huge hole was chewed out of the pressed-fibre panelling beside milo. he opened fire, lurched back for a moment by the u90's almost unmanageable recoil. the hi-ex ap rounds blew the lizard thing apart and hosed the wall with its unwholesome blood. he heard nessa scream. the creature she had shot was lurching up again, sweeping its flechette blaster towards milo. milo emptied the rest of the drum mag into the second loxad, pulping its head and chest. he looked round at nessa. come on! he signed. she nodded and pulled him towards the doorway the loxatl had come through. trusting her, milo realised she was right. the blood pact squads were storming up the rear of the hab, intending to pick off any fleeing stragglers the loxad had missed. no one was expecting anybody to exit from the front of the building. nessa and milo, hand in hand, raced out of the hab tenement, and sprinted away towards the forbidding shells of residence blocks on the far side of the square. in the hab behind them, nessa's grave marker lay crushed under the bulk of a dead loxatl. they'd had to wait the best part of the day for a chance to sneak back to the air wharf, where it took them just ninety seconds to commandeer the carrier. banda's long-shot took out the driver, and bonin and varl did the rest with warknives. they hefted up the heretics' corpses and threw them on to the carrier's cargo bed. it was a light hauler, with a roofed cabin section and a tarp-covered payload bay. expertly, jagdea launched them, and they flew down a canyon of habs towards the porta of alpha dome. at just about the same time, far to the north-west, mkoll was scaling the granite outcrop where the pipeline finally joined ouranberg. it was dark, freezing cold, and the wind was fearful, but he felt triumphant. he had made it all the way across. now all he had to do was get inside. convoys of transport vehicles loaded with munitions for alpha dome's air defences had been rumbling down the access routes non-stop for over an hour. larisel 2 had been forced into hiding until the activity died down. they waited, with nervy impatience, in the basement of a burned-out ministorum chapel. kuren watched the door, armed with meryn's u90. mkvenner said. he'd been searching through the broken litter that covered the basement floor, and now held up a cheap plaster figurine, one of a dozen he'd found in a box. � he was riding next to her in the hauler's cab. they had got through the porta into alpha dome with remarkable ease, and joined an access route that had seemed busy enough for them to blend in. varl hoped they might get as far as the dome's core districts by midnight. but the traffic was slowing, and armoured blood part air-speeders with rotating orange lamps were forcing all vehicles down to road level so that they could be channelled through a check station. they were barely crawling, following the tail of a large munitions truck. she hissed. varl peered down the line of near stationary traffic ahead and behind them. the six-lane route itself was open, with little cover, and thirty storey tenements rose on either side. not the place for a firefight. he cursed himself. using the hauler had been a smart idea, and it had saved them a lot of time. but jagdea and bonin had advised him to ditch it once they were inside alpha dome. varl had wanted to press on, to see how far they could get. he felt stupid now, like he'd let them down. even though gol kolea was nowhere around, the kolea-varl devil-dare rivalry had landed them in this fix.  gol had been the hero at cirenholm. shutting down the power plant like that had effectively won the battle for them. he'd triumphed that round. when operation larisel came up, all varl had been able to think of was that this might be his turn. his turn to be the hero. devildare, kolea! how d'you like that? so he'd pushed them on, far further than they should ever have gone out in the open like this. he had pushed them so they would reach slaith and be heroes. bonin whispered sharply. banda, vadim and unterrio raised their weapons to their shoulders. bonin put his laspistol on his lap. the vehicles moved forward again, another few metres. a blood pact officer, standing on the route's central barrier, waved the three trucks immediately in front of them on with a torch stick. said jagdea. four more blood pact troopers and a slaver with a team of hate-dogs approached behind the officer. he walked towards the hauler. jagdea screamed. the front of the tenement was approaching very fast. varl threw back the tarp and stood up so he could fire over the roof of the cab. he had to fight to stay upright. they were going to hit the wall in scant seconds. he fired the u90 and created a rippling blister of overlapping explosions that blew the ground floor facade in. they went through the hole. almost. varl had barely ducked in again when an overhang of brick caught the tarp of the speeding machine and ripped the entire cover frame off. that tipped the nose up and spun the back end out. the left rear engine mount sheared off against an exposed metal beam and a considerable portion of the hauler's underside shredded away. the tenement's ground floor was one great, open space used for storage and presently empty, except for the metre square rockcrete pillars every thirty paces. the stricken machine flew into the store-space almost sidelong. it hit the floor once with boneshaking force, bounced up under its own headlong momentum, and then impacted again, shrieking along the floor in an astonishing wake of sparks and fragmenting metal. it hit the first pillar head-on with enough force to spin it off the ground and leave it crumpled and smoking, facing the way it had come. varl and banda had both been thrown clear and lay unconscious on the ground nearby. unterrio got to his feet and tried to get vadim up. the young verghastite had struck his head and was out cold. unterrio screamed. bonin came round. he was hanging out of the shattered cab section. it took him a moment to work out what was going on. he could hear unterrio shouting. jagdea, saved by her harness belt, was alive but semi conscious. bonin fought with her harness and began to drag her out. powerful searchlights lanced in through the street windows and the hole. silhouetted against them, figures were surging in. unterrio leapt out of the carrier and opened fire with his lascarbine. something small and hard and metallic landed near to bonin and came skittering to rest. he howled, though he was pretty sure no one was in any state to obey. the mine went off with a silent flash, like a falling star, that flared for a moment, bright and then went out. and as he collapsed, paralysed, bonin knew that his own lucky star had finally gone out too. five it was midnight on the 225th. the massed forces of operation thunderhead were beginning to leave cirenholm, streaming in convoy out into the night, heading for ouranberg. the vast bomber waves went out first with their interceptor escorts. it was a clear night, and up in the cockpits of the magogs, it seemed to the aircrews like they were part of new constellations issuing from the city. the drogues that would convey the main army forces began to depart, sliding up into the cold night air in the wake of the bombers, rotor blades chopping. thunderbolt escorts cruised in beside them. the drogues zephyr, aeolus and trenchant, heavy with krassian and urdeshi infantry regiments, headed out on a long path that would eventually turn them west to assault the main airwharfs and drome structure of ouranberg. the ghosts were boarding the nimbus, which, as part of a pack of six drogues, would convey the main assault force of tanith, phantine and urdeshi to the southern face of ouranberg. o-day. by dawn the next day, all hell would be unleashed. gaunt checked his despatch orders for a final time, signed them, and handed them to beltayn, who hurried them off to van voytz. rawne, daur, hark and the other senior officers waited for him outside the office.  he rose, put on his cap, and led the tanith commanders onto the main troop deck. no word had yet come from any larisel group. he wondered how many of them might still be alive. on the massive troop deck, thousands of battle-ready ghosts were being conducted in prayer by ayatani zweil. zweil saw the officers approach, and finished his reading from the gospel of saint sabbat. he closed the old book and smoothed his robes. the emperor protects. know that , remember that, and he will. so let me tell you this. colonel corbec and sergeant soric are both out of danger. criid shouted. this time, the medics were going in with the troop assault. curth's medi-pack was fully prepped, but she was struggling with the body armour gaunt had issued. shouldn't you be on the troop decks? yes. but i had to see you first. he said stepping back. she gazed at his face. it was unreadable. it's let me off too many times recently. i'm not saying i'm going to do something foolhardy, but it's a feeling i have. now i've made up my mind to tell criid god! i thought you were dead! what happened? wind-waste� she said. viltry said. jagdea looked across at bonin and smiled. a weary smile, but not a defeated one. he gestured at the bronze cauldron. i wondered why he hadn't killed us yet. said larkin. mkvenner looked up. pandemonium had instantly overtaken the crowd below, and the blood pact were surging towards the eastern side of the concourse. larkin trained his long-las again, staring through the scope. larkin said. meryn demanded. larkin fired, and slaith was slammed over onto his back. at the same moment, a second hot-shot stabbed in from the munitorium and dipped the edge of the cauldron. blood pact and loxad were tearing through the crowd towards the foot of the stock exchange. larkin fired again, hitting slaith cleanly. but the warlord got up, assisted by his men. his personal shield had held. bonin laughed aloud, and drove the fight towards the bewildered enemy. flanked by a bodyguard of three blood pact officers and two loxatl, sagittar slaith hurried back into the palace. he was cursing and swearing, bruised and shaken by the savage hits his personal shield had taken. as he stormed back into his private apartment, the floor began to shake. it was nearly dawn and overhead the first waves of bombers had reached ouranberg. slaith turned slowly to his officers, smouldering with his infamous rage. the blood pact shook behind their iron grotesques, and even the xenos warriors closed their nictating han lids. slaith opened his mouth, but it was not his fury that hit them. a rain of shots from a lasrifle on full auto killed the blood pact officers instantly and exploded harmlessly off slaith's screen and the reflective hides of the two loxad. there was a human standing in the rear doorway of the room. an imperial soldier half-shrouded in a ragged camo-cape, his lasrifle aimed at them. the real surprise is under that table. nooooooo! gaunt's unfinished question was finally answered late that afternoon, when urdeshi units searching the ruins of the palace found a lone tanith scout unconscious in the rubble. his tags said his name was mkoll. rawne's forces were being hammered by the loxad in the palatial habs west of the alpha dome heartland. the aliens were using some kind of heavy fragmentation mortar, perhaps a larger-scale version of their signature flechette blasters. obel had pressed his unit forward, and bragg had managed to hose one loxad position with cannonfire, but the deadly shells were still whooping down.  with troopers lubba and jajjo, gol kolea had broken through the back wall of a ransacked kitchen into some kind of service tunnel that allowed them to advance right up to flank the main loxad dug-outs. emerging from the tunnel, hunched low, kolea could hear the regular punk-shiff! of the loxad mortars, and a human voice screaming for a medic. the trio ran low across debris-littered rockcrete and scooted behind an exploded water main that was weeping frothy water into the road. caffran was lying on his back in a nearby shell-hole. his leg was lacerated with loxatl barb shrapnel. lubba yelped, but kolea was already running. flechette shot winnowed the air around him and he threw himself into the shell-hole. kolea. feth, it hurts. kolea looked at the wounds. caffran said. i got caught here, she went on with alio and jenk. i think they were hit too. caff, it must be the parent in me. he jumped out of the shell-hole and started to run. allo and jenk were dead. criid was sprawled beside their remains, wounded in the arm and side. enemy fire wailed around them. he scooped her up in his arms, ignoring her moans of pain and started to run back the way he had come. she wailed as flechette shot exploded around them. caill hurried away. bragg looked over at the other ghosts in the shelled out basement: tokar, fenix, cuu and hwlan. he said. hwlan, fenix and tokar surged out, running the gauntlet of fire. bragg felt blood pouring out of his scalp. he was dizzy and sick. lijah cuu was standing, staring at him. bragg tried to get up. just so's you know� it was me. i did her. and it was beautiful. she fought oh how she fought. bragg suddenly lurched up and swung the autocannon around by the barrel like a club. if it had connected with the lean verghastite it would surely have crippled him. and again. and again. epilogue: the guns of tanith phantine, 227.771, m41 � ibram gaunt, c-in-c, tanith first the drogue had docked just a few minutes before, but already the children were running out and playing. the ghosts' entourage had reached ouranberg as part of the mass reinforcement wave. surly wharf masters oversaw the unloading of cargo freight, while men who would soon become jugglers, mimes, fire-eaters and knife-sharpeners haggled with them over the safe deposition of their worldly goods. and the children were loose. laughing, chanting, scampering around the docking bay. the surgeon looked round. the battle's won, the dead are dead, and now the kids arrive to make us all soft and sad. well, i'm not gakking sad. life sucks. gol kolea came back� but he didn't come back. i� curth folded up the letter and slowly wandered back up the docking ramp into the city. van voytz had been effusive in his praise.  he was full of talk of commendations and decorations. he spoke about petitioning macaroth to officially change the tanith first's regimental designation to reflect its specialist stealth and infiltration strengths. gaunt hadn't really been listening. the arch-enemy had been deprived of phantine. a significant heretic leader had been eliminated. the crusade force would now benefit from the planet's massive vapour mill output. and he had kept alive as many men as possible in the pursuit of those goals. it was a victory, and duty had been done. gaunt just didn't share van voytz's desire to toast the living and the dead and talk about it all night. he walked alone through the imperial concourse. clearance teams were still searching the surrounding buildings for enemy survivors. gaunt supposed that the curse of mid-ranking officers like himself was that they were still close enough to the sharp end to feel the loss. the gaunts and rawnes and fazalurs of this galaxy were the ones who got to cope with the bloody aftermath of victory. the lord generals got to celebrate each triumph because, to them, the dead were just names on data-slates. the chain of rank insulated them from the emotional consequence. it made a generally decent man like van voytz seem just as heartless as some of the callous bastards gaunt had been forced to follow in his time. at least the perceived rift between the tanith and the verghastite that hark and zweil had chided him about appeared to be easing. during the fight for ouranberg, the regiment had seemed much more of a single, integrated whole. maybe sticking up for cuu had sent the right message. gaunt returned to his section and had beltayn transmit his respectful thanks to all tanith and verghastites alike via all section leaders, along with the order for the regiment to pull out. urdeshi and krassian reinforcements from cirenholm were coming in to supervise the occupation. the guns of tanith could fall silent for a while, and rest. a warhammer 40,000 novel sabbat martyr gaunt's ghosts - 07 it is the 41st millennium. for more than a hundred centuries the emperor has sat immobile on the golden throne of earth. he is the master of mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. he is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the dark age of technology. he is the carrion lord of the imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die. yet even in his deathless state, the emperor continues his eternal vigilance. mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the emperor's will. vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. greatest amongst his soldiers are the adeptus astartes, the space marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. their comrades in arms are legion: the imperial guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant inquisition and the tech-priests of the adeptus mechanicus to name only a few. but for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants � and worse. to be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. it is to live in the cruellest and most bloody regime imaginable. these are the tales of those times. forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. macaroth eventually decided to remain as he was, risking overstretch, and fight on to take morlond with one last effort. in the third quarter of 773, enok innokenti began his murderous, catastrophic flank attack in the khan group. prologue the intelligence, such as it was, had been in their possession for a week. yet two or three times a day, and more often during the watches of the night, he would review it, as if somehow he expected it to change. etrodai wasn't sure what that meant. he wasn't sure if it meant he was excited by the news, or disquieted. that troubled etrodai enormously, for he prided himself on knowing his whims and moods like no other. etrodai had been his lifeward for ninety-two years, had won that vaunted position by besting the previous holder of the office in a legal murder-fight. no one knew him better than etrodai. except now, etrodai was no wiser than the rest. all along the tarnished pillars and dusty alcoves of the process, the cobwebs fluttered and the bones began to chatter. it meant he was restless again. before the onyx door had even opened, etrodai was on his feet, his changeling blade skinned and raised in front of his face. etrodai waited, attentive, apprehensive. the chatter became more urgent. the dry, beetle-clicks of the human skulls, most of them mottled brown with decay as if they had been varnished, were bearable enough. the sounds of the more alien skulls were harder to tolerate. they lisped and coughed, clucking like birds, ticking like clocks, disarticulated mouthparts twitching in the dust like dead leaves. once, while he had been resting to heal a psi wound, etrodai had idled the long hours attempting to count the skulls in the process. he had given up around about ten thousand. they kept interrupting him and making him lose count.  a soft rumble, and the onyx door, tall as five men and as broad, slid back into the wet marrow of its hatch seal. warm air exhaled through the gap. the bones fell silent. he emerged from his inviolable chamber. the null field popped like surface tension around him. but first� i will review this great truth one last time. the notion chilled etrodai and he seemed to notice the look on the lifeward's face. a respectful silence awaited them on the hinterdeck. the only sound was the gusty hiss of the air scrubbers and the sub-threshold harmonic thrum of the massive warp engines twenty decks above. the hinterdeck was a subsidiary landing platform, reserved for the magister's personal use. it jutted out like a shelf high above the long, gothic vault, fifteen hectares square, that formed the primary flight deck for the colossal flagship's fighter screen. the squadrons had been ramped out to secure storage during the voyage. the echoing space below was empty now except for rows of energy bowsers, electric munition trains, and the launch cradles hanging like open crab claws from the high roof. yellow lights winked in series along the runways scribed into the battered floor. there were eight beings assembled there in the middle of the empty metal platform. he had specifically requested nine for, according to him, nine was a significant number. the ninth, too dangerous for direct intercourse, was suspended in a null field outside the hull, in the mouth of the main bay, connected by tele-audience relay to the proceedings on the high platform. etrodai ordered the retinue to wait by the entry hatch, and then stood beside him as he presented himself to the assembled figures. etrodai's skinned blade was so hungry by then that blood was dripping off his knuckles and his arms ached with it. but etrodai would not reskin his blade until it was all done. he paused. � some in the crowd were booing him. others made the sign of the aquila or the beati mark to ward off any evil luck he was bringing on with his words. others, anton alphant noticed wryly, were listening quite intently. there was nothing new in the man's rantings. he, and others like him throughout the camps, had been causing scenes like this regularly in recent days. it wasn't good for morale, and it certainly wasn't endearing the pilgrim mass to the city authorities. almsmen, their rank denoted by the blue ribbons that fluttered from their long dust-cloaks, were trying to coax the man down off the wagon. his feet had already knocked over several sacks of the corn-wafers and hardtack they had brought to distribute through the camp. an ayatani from one of the farworld congregations had elbowed his way through the crowd and was holding up a prayer-paddle as he shouted benedictions at the man. two junior ecclesiarchy adepts were clutching pewter cups and using their silver aspergillums to shake water at the improvising preacher. holy water, alphant was sure, that they had purchased at great expense from the stoups of the holy balneary. alphant closed his fingers around the ampulla of holy water in his own coat pocket. he'd come an awfully long way to get it, and it had cost him the last of his coins. the brink of midnight, and then the bad day dawns! valmont asked. how many times had he said that? just an agri-worker from khan ii who had made the pilgrimage here when he'd heard the news because it seemed like the right thing to do. along the way � and it had been a hard journey � he'd somehow become the nominal leader of those he'd travelled with. they looked to him for opinion and direction, more than ever since they'd reached the cold, austere reality of the camps. he'd never asked for the responsibility. then, of course, she'd never asked for hers. alphant had no idea where that sudden, sobering notion had sprung from. but it was enough to make him change his mind, hand his bowl and breviary to karel, and walk towards the ruckus around the wagon. he'd gone no more than three steps when someone in the angry crowd hurled a lump of quartz at the gibbering man. it missed, but others followed. one cracked against his forehead the crowd went mad. fighting broke out, and more missiles flew � rocks, ampullas, bless-bottles. the alms wagon overturned with a crash and people started shrieking. alphant put his head down and shouldered into the surging mob. the hapless preacher would be torn apart in this, and the last thing the camp needed was a death. alphant was still a strong man, and he found he remembered some of the old moves, enough to tackle and dissuade the most boisterous rioters in his path anyway. nothing too vicious, just a little deflection and the occasional squeeze of a nerve point. he got round the upturned wagon, and paused to prevent three screaming infardi from throttling one of the almsmen. then he looked for the preacher who had started it all. and saw an amazing thing. the preacher was sitting on the rough ground, both hands clamped to his forehead. blood was pouring out through his fingers, staining his robes and making dark patches in the dust. he was in no state to protect himself. but no one was touching him. a girl, a young girl no more than eighteen, was standing over him. her face, thin and pale, was confident, the look in her green eyes soft. she had one hand extended, palm out, to ward off the riot. every time a part of it spilled towards her, she moved her hand in that direction and the people drew back. that simply, that quietly, she was maintaining a tiny circle of calm around the preacher, keeping at bay a crowd lusting for his blood. he moved towards her. alphant asked. her voice was tiny, but he heard her clearly over the uproar. he bent down at her side, and examined the preacher's injury. it was deep and dirty. he tore a strip off his shirt, and wetted it with water from his ampulla without even thinking of the cost. wasn't it said to cure all wounds? alphant didn't question her any further. he got his hands under the preacher's arms and hoisted him up. when he'd got the lolling man upright he realised that the girl had disappeared. and the nature of the uproar around him had changed. it wasn't a riot any more it was a panic. people were fleeing, screaming, falling over one another in their anxiety to leave. something was burning. smoke filled the low sky above the ironhall camp. the signalman called back a moment later. the engines of the apcs were revving, and the vast crowds packing the street were wailing and shouting. gorgonaught, the great prayer horn at the northern end of principal i, was booming at the white sky from its ancient tower. udol was sure he could also hear the slap of distant detonations and the sizzling kiss of impacts against the outer fan of shield cover. it was coming down again, fourth day in a row. udol slithered down inside the hull and cranked his bare-metal rocker seat around so he could look over the signalman's shoulder at the screen. he adjusted his vox set's channel. objections and several requests for clarification crackled back, but udol ignored them. he tapped his driver on the arm and pointed. the carrier obediently veered east parting the rushing crowds with blares from its warning sirens. two other units from the convoy turned with it. they got off the guild slope and rumbled down a gravel linkway deeply shadowed by the tall buildings on either side. at the end of the linkway, the buildings framed an oblong of sky stained with clots of smoke. they emerged onto principal vi, flanked by low-rise habs, and crossed the wide boulevard until they were facing the towering lime-brick arches of the simeon aqueduct. beyond that massive arched structure lay the open reaches of a glass field. like so many vacant spaces at the city edges, the area had become a pilgrim shanty over the last two months, a sea of rough canvas tents, survival blisters and hastily raised clock shrines. another makeshift expansion of the city's limits to accommodate the massive influx of believers. filthy brown smoke billowed across the whole campsite and washed out between the arches of the aqueduct. the driver dropped the gears down to the lowest ratio and began to roll the carrier through the nearest arch span onto the obsidae. almost at once they were crushing tent structures and lean-tos under their heavy, solid wheels. frantic pilgrims, flowing around the vehicle as they fled the area, hammered their fists on the armoured sides and implored them to stop. the side hatches on all three troop carriers rattled open and the troops dismounted, fifteen from each. they lunged their way forward against the tide of the crowd, carrying their weapons upright udol paused long enough for inkerz to strap the compact accelerant tank to his back and connect the hose, then he took off, pushing to the head of his men. he raised his armoursleeved left arm, squeezed the stirrup built into the palm of the glove, and scorched off a little rippling halo of flame into the air so they could pick him out in the crush. once he had their attention, he dispersed them left and right through the forest of tents and personal detritus. fifty paces into the shanty, the place was almost deserted. the smoke was thicker. udol was appalled but unsurprised at the wretched conditions the pilgrims had been living in. junk, rubbish and human waste covered the narrow tracks that wound between the pathetic tents. it was hard to see more than a few metres in any direction. quite apart from the smoke and the shelters, there were clock shrines everywhere no two were identical, but they all followed the same essential pattern: a timepiece of some sort � domestic clock, electric timer, digital chronometer, handsprung horolog � set in a home-made wooden box, the taller and more gaudily painted the better, it seemed. he looked at one nearby. as tall as a man, with reclaimed tin shutters open at the top to reveal the clock face, it was set on a wooden handcart and anchored in place with industrial rivets. the thing had been painted gold and silver and, in places, green, and skirts of plastic sheeting had been wrapped around the towering body. inside that upright box, a stationary pendulum hung down, festooned with dried flowers, crystals, keepsakes, coins and a hundred other votive offerings. at the top, inside the shutters, the old clock face and the hands had been sprayed green and then the dial and the tips of the hands picked out again in gold. the hands were set at a heartbeat before midnight. major udol knew precisely the significance of that. he went around the shrine, waving the troopers behind him close. the pilgrim shelters ahead of them were burning freely.  dirty yellow flames licked away shelter cloth and canvas and leapt up into the morning air, swirling into dense, dark smoke udol saw a clock shrine in the heart of the fire succumb and topple. the trooper beside him suddenly jumped back, as if in surprise. then he did it again and fell on his back. shot through the torso, twice. udol didn't even have to look. he barked a hasty warning into his vox. the men around him scattered into cover. two-thirds of them made it the bastards had been waiting. udol crouched down behind the relative shelter of an overturned flatbed as energy bolts spat and whistled overhead. one of his men nearby got in behind the frame of a plastic tent and then rolled over onto his side as a lasround came through the fabric skin and into the back of his head. another man, caught in the open, was knocked over by a laser bolt that broke both his legs. he fell hard, and started crawling until another shot hit him in the face. udol felt his heart race. he glimpsed movement on the pathway next to the fire, drew his laspistol, and fired a few bright bars of energy down the narrow track. the troopers around him began to open up with their carbines. farenx. beresi. udol heard himself say. the stalk-tanks came on, scuttling like arachnids. each had six pistongeared legs that supported the low-slung body casings. udol could see the drivers in the underslung bubbles beneath the tails. on each raised head section, dual mini-turrets rotated and began to fire. the blistering shots came in constant, rippling waves as the barrels of the double pulse lasers in each mini-turret pumped, recoiled and fired again with brutal, mechanised rhythm. udol saw beresi cut in two, and three other troopers lifted off the ground by the overpressure of impact blasts. detonations threw pumice and obsidian chips into the air. twinkling scratches of light flickered along the advancing row of blood-red troopers as they began to fire their weapons too. udol fell into cover. he heard men he'd known since childhood screaming their last words into their moulded rebreather masks. he did the only thing he could think of. he prayed to the saint. fifteen kilometres south, at the crest levels of the inner city, the immortal choir was tuning up. he was a small man, with a cleanly shaved scalp and a neatly clipped goatee. he settled his mantle of office around his shoulders with a fastidious gesture, and double-checked that his amulet was hanging squarely on his chest. by his side, marshal biagi folded his huge arms and sighed. is it perfect? good. excellent.  why are those little boys wandering off? will he? i hope so. i want everything to be perfect. these are heroes we're welcoming today. veterans. a shadow flickered past overhead, momentarily blotting out the skylights of the ceremonial docking terrace. rampshel raised his arms and the choir began to sing. he was conducting them strenuously when the first set of the terrace's inner hatches cycled open and steam hissed in. first officiary leger wasn't quite sure what to expect, except something heroic. the choir, lungs bursting and antiphonals held open in front of them, voiced the great supplication of the beati. they were bloody well almost in tune too. two figures sauntered down out of the steam. they came side by side. a louche male with a handsome face and the eyes of a joker, and a slender female with cropped bleached hair and an attitude. both were dressed in matt-black fatigues and body armour; both had lasrifles slung casually over their shoulders. the man had an augmetic shoulder, and winked the moment he saw leger. the woman was wearing a fur-trimmed bomber jacket, and carried her lasrifle yoked horizontally so that her right arm could hang near the trigger grip and her left folded casually over the top like it was a speeder's door. they stalked down into the docking terrace, ignoring the efforts of the choir. leger stepped forward. behind him, the female completed her sight check of the area and raised a hand to her headset. an imposing figure in a long coat and a peaked cap. first officiary leger breathed in expectantly. the figure walked into the light. he was a tall, lean man in the field dress of a commissar, but his epaulettes showed the rank of colonel. his face was as hard as a knife. so this was the famous gaunt, thought biagi. he wasn't especially impressed. gaunt and his men, so the briefing files had said, were front-line grunts. they certainly had that mad dog smell about them. not house-trained. biagi had serious doubts they were suitable for the task they had been chosen to perform. he had to stand on tiptoe to do this. gaunt seemed to tolerate the custom the way a guard dog tolerates the occasional brisk rub between the ears. leger began to make a fuller and longer speech of welcome in high gothic. gaunt saluted. biagi grinned. seemed this famous pack leader couldn't even keep his dogs in line. though tall, he was a very old man, yet his gaze had more strength and confidence in it than that of either the marshal or the first officiary. kilosh nodded, as if appeased. and a bleak time for my holy order. but times have changed. the miracle has happened. leger nodded eagerly, and made another little bow. gaunt turned away and walked back towards the docking hatches. he paused as he saw a thick set man in the uniform of a line commissar emerge from one of the hatches. tanith personnel poured out onto the assembly floor. as he strode down the metal deckway, biagi could see hatch after hatch opening along the ornamental terrace. men and, in places, women, clad in the same dirty black and draped with camo-capes, were exiting the fleet of drop craft, lugging munition boxes, stow crates and kitbags. they had a smell to them. the smell of dirt and fyceline and jellied promethium that no amount of bathing could scrub out.  the shadows of other landing ships flickered across the terrace skylights, and there was the thump � and dank of landing clamps engaging. steam vented through the floor grates. the newcomers gave biagi a courteous wide berth. he was a senior officer, and also an imposing figure. shaven-headed, with dark olive skin and amber eyes, he wore the ceremonial battledress of the city regiment: gleaming brown leather embossed with gold-wire detailing. his left arm and chest were covered with polished, segmented armour plating and, on his back, under the fold of the scarlet sash, his accelerant tank was locked in place. biagi stopped as he came on three troopers hefting a pallet of promethium tanks out of a landing hatch. asked biagi. � is a privilege exercised only by the high-born warrior class. gingerly lowering his aged frame, ayatani zweil prostrated himself and kissed the metal deck, murmuring prayers that he had known most of his days but which only now seemed to have meaning. there were ghosts all around him, off-loading from the landers. many knelt down around him, producing their own green silk faith ribbons and kissing them the way he had taught them. they were faithful, these boys and girls, these soldiers. it was a glorious thing to see. he unwound his own beaded green ribbon from around his wizened knuckles and began to recite the litany. gaunt appeared beside him and gently raised him to his feet. zweil huffed but allowed gaunt to lead him out of the way as obel and garond manhandled a crate of rockets out onto the docking terrace with an anti-grav hoist. gaunt asked. the imhava ayatani stared up at gaunt with ferociously beady eyes. zweil snorted. if gaunt had suggested such a thing back on aexe, he might well have agreed. back there, he'd tried to ignore the signs, but there had been no denying that his great age was catching up with him. he had honestly begun to wonder how much longer fate was going to give him. then, the news had come. and new vitality had filled his arthritic joints and dimming mind. zweil grinned. gaunt breathed deeply. gaunt left the old priest and edged through the press of disembarking ghosts. surgeon ana curth looked up from a shipment of sterilised theatre tools she had been itemising. gaunt winced. okay. you win. i'll get my kit, even though� even though , mind� i don't like it. the ghosts around them came to a sudden halt. several dropped their kitbags. sir? gaunt tipped his head down and looked at beltayn. beltayn grimaced toothily and nodded. let me guess i was asking after them. he didn't quite know what to say. the big stranger jerked a thumb at the sky. we've been stacked orbital for the last sixteen hours, then we got the word to go to landers, for which everyone gave thanks. so, we're on the way down and the word comes up there's an attack and we gotta abort the drop. yes, we did. i see it as an economy of effort, myself. if we were going to drop anyways, we might as well drop for a purpose. and so we did. fething good thing too. by the way, who are you? observe the debris, the pleasant lack of incoming fire, and the arses of many enemies fleeing for safety. the tanith. you're the ones. corbec's impromptu relief force, four platoons strong, assembled itself into vaguely ordered groups at the edge of the fight zone. word was the officer in charge of the local force had voxed tactical logistical command to request transports to take them into the city proper. major rawne of the tanith ghosts, ranking third officer beneath gaunt and commander of third platoon, wandered away from the makeshift assembly point and stood alone, slowly turning in a circle to take in the scene this was his first look at herodor, a world that had taken them months of monotonous travel to reach. a world, so he understood, that contained a great miracle. it was not a pretty place, and didn't look at all miraculous, but it had a sort of cold beauty, rawne conceded. the sky was a flat, bright white, with the merest smudges of grey-blue along the horizon, particularly in the north, where dirty crusts of rock pushed up into the air. the ground around them � an obsidae, the locals called it � was a bare field of blue dust, littered with black volcanic glass. the thin air was cold, and abrasively dry. rawne had been told most of herodor was an arctic desert: a dry, sub-zero waste of dust fields, glass crags and crumbling escarpments. it reminded him, unpleasantly, of death, of the cold, desiccated, brittle truth contained in all tombs. the ghosts had yet to go to a world that did not cost them life and blood. what price was herodor going to demand? whose last sight would be these forlorn wastes? any of us, he thought. all of us. death is never choosy, never selective.  on aexe cardinal, he'd come to within touching distance of death himself. he sensed that cold grasp was still on him, reluctant to let him go again. or maybe that was just the chill wind gusting in across the obsidae. rawne's slow circle of contemplation brought him up at last looking south at the city itself. the civitas beati, the city of the saint, a minor shrine, just another of the many places and many worlds touched by sabbat thousands of years earlier and made holy. it was a sprawling place the main population centre on herodor. three slab-like hive towers of white ashlar stood like bodyguards around a higher, older, darker central steeple, encircled by sloping skirts of lower level habs, manufactories, transitways and brick viaducts. to the west lay the tinted domes of the many agriponic farms that fed the city, farms that were themselves kept alive by the hot mineral springs on which the city had been founded. that's what made it a special place, rawne thought pragmatically. it wasn't who might have been here or what they might have done. this city was here only by the grace of the thermal water that gushed up through the cold crust of the world in this one place. rawne heard someone shout his name. the shout was muffled by a rebreather mask. that which dieth will live. that which falleth will rise up. this, i say to you, is the nature of things, if you but once believe. �saint sabbat, epistles he stood on one of the highest decks of the inner hive and looked down over the sprawl of beati city, across the ceramite and white-ashlar slopes of the hive towers, the mosaic of brick-tile rooftops lower down, crosscut by the lines of boulevards and viaducts, the mouldering stone of the old districts, the stained metal sides of the processors and agriponic domes, the maze of alleys and slums, the warrens of low-rise habs. not a secure town. not secure or securable. there were no curtain walls or encircling fortifications, except the natural bowl of rocky headlands around the valley site. there was a shield system, generated by pylon stations around the city limits which, along with main sequence masts on the roofs of the hive towers, could raise a coherent energy field like a carnival marquee above the city. but the shield system had been designed to ward off dust storms and glass blizzards, not munitions. and that was what was coming. full-scale war, drawn inexorably towards herodor as surely as the pilgrim flocks had been drawn. the civitas beati would not survive. it hadn't been constructed for war, and he didn't know how he would begin to defend it. he thought of vervunhive � great, solid vervunhive � and how hard that had been to hold on to. vervunhive had been designed by military planners with principles of defence uppermost in their minds. its main spine and curtain walls had formed a solid fortress within which the entire hive population could shelter during times of attack and siege. beati city, in contrast, had simply grown, spilling low-rent, lowrise habs out further and further from its more modest and overcrowded hive towers. god-emperor, but this was going to be fething bloody. gaunt turned from the tinted observation window and scribbled some more notes down on the data-slate he'd kept at his side since arriving, every last idea he had to make the city as proof against assault as possible. stronger shield generators, for a start. mobile artillery batteries, and some real armour. reinforcements, naturally. the damnably wide boulevards would have to be blocked, and the aqua system managed. food and power and munitions had to be stockpiled. according to the last navy report, the munitorum fleet was two days out, and a three regiment force, including armour, was inbound from khan. herodor needed battlefleet cover too, and he'd put in a request, through channels, for assistance from the adeptus mechanicus, though no answer had yet come. he heard the door to the wood-panelled deck open and presumed it was beltayn, returning at long last with caffeine and a snack. corbec grinned and nodded. he was munching on a cut of bread filled with salt-meat, and carried a hot cup of caffeine in his other hand. rawne, coming in behind him, carried two more cups and handed one to gaunt. gaunt shook his head dismissively. so� any sign of this impending doom? fleet has nothing. corbec set down his empty cup and brushed crumbs off his tunic. gaunt shrugged. rawne had left the door open and no one had heard the newcomer walk in. they leapt to their feet and saluted. perhaps a moment alone �? gaunt nodded. he found it difficult to answer. lord general lugo was, in his opinion, one of the most inept and self-aggrandising officers in the crusade's upper command echelon, a political animal rather than a military leader. in 770, he had negotiated for himself command of the liberation of the shrineworld hagja, believing it to be a simple task that would win him much glory and bolster his political ambitions. when the liberation effort went disastrously wrong, he had blamed gaunt and tried to make the tanith first's commander carry the can. in doing so, he nearly lost the entire shrineworld to chaos, a calamity only averted by the tanith during the peculiar happenings at the shrinehold itself. after hagia, his slate clean, gaunt had been transferred with his forces to the phantine theatre. lugo, though not actually disgraced, had remained on hagia as imperial governor, his ambitions in tatters. sadly, that meant he had been in exactly the right place to benefit from the extraordinary events that then took place there. his star was now in the ascendant again. he was, by default in control of what might prove to be the most influential part of the entire imperial interest in the sabbat worlds. rumours were already spreading that lugo could be looking to replace macaroth as warmaster if the current stagnation continued. he was very much the coming man. gaunt could almost smell that confidence and ambition on the lord general. it was actually the smell of hair tonic and cologne, but to gaunt such pampering scents were the same thing. lugo had his sights on power. real power. it gave him an appetite so great you could almost hear his stomach growling. and it was absolutely obvious that the last thing lugo wanted in his path was ibram gaunt who had shamed him so on hagia. no reason indeed. gaunt was smiling because, for the first time since he'd received his orders on aexe cardinal, he was pleased to be on herodor. as he understood it he was only here because she had requested it. lugo would never have sent for gaunt. whoever � whatever � she was, she had clout. she was in charge here, really in charge, and lugo was forced to obey her will. lugo and his tacticians were taking her seriously. either that, or lugo's capacity for intrigue was so great gaunt couldn't even begin to see its devious mechanisms. lugo nodded. he had stalked over to the window and was staring out at the city as the first shrouds of evening began to fall across the scene. lugo watched the city lights as they came on in the covering darkness. a wind from the wastes had picked up and pattered glass flecks against the thick window pane. he was smiling now. she is made flesh so that she might lead us to victory here in the worlds that bear her name. this is a moment undreamt of in human history! a moment of sacred wonder! and you remain to be convinced? ibram. he took a few steps and began to move around the side of the pool. he lunged at her and grabbed her. she thrust out a hand and pushed his face aside, but he shook it off and yanked back her hood. sanian pulled away from him and dragged her robe tight. she stared at him with eyes he couldn't fathom. understand this, ibram. how else might i come back? how else might i find flesh to clothe me? this is a trick. lugo is using you. gaunt stared at lugo for a moment. and that's all that matters. gaunt marched away from the balneary and the lord general's retinue, and headed down the long, stone colonnade that led to the nearest elevator bank. the attendants from the balneary, the hierarchs and adepts who had withdrawn from the place at lugo's approach, were waiting quietly in the colonnade, silent robed figures in the gloom. curth called as she ran after him. he didn't break stride. when she finally caught up with him, he was waiting outside the iron cage door of the elevator for a lift car to arrive. he looked at her, his eyes in shadow. he seemed surprised at her reply, as if he'd been expecting her to say no. the mechanically wound elevator car clanked and moaned to a halt, and he wrenched open the collapsible cage door. curth had to leap in after him to stop him closing the cage in her face. for a moment, she thought he was going to pull the cage open again and order her out. instead, he walked to the wall panel and pulled on the brass lever. the elevator began to rise, gears whirring in the blackness of the shaft. curth asked. gaunt said nothing. with a sigh, she leaned over and pulled the brass lever down to suspend motion. the elevator clanked to a halt between floors. somewhere, a buzzer rang. an amber light began to flash on the control panel. curth shook her head. she shrugged. he stared at her. her eyes widened. just an annexe. daur thought it might do as a briefing room. the munitorum's bringing chairs up, and a few tables. beltayn's organised some food too. i want you, dorden, zweil and daur in the annexe for a privy briefing. corbec started. zweil had become so upset that dorden and curth had both risen to their feet. gaunt shot a dangerous look in hark's direction. he was staring at gaunt. gaunt asked. on aexe cardinal. through her servant. ayatani zweil� i told you that in strictest confidence it was meant to remain between just us. an act of confession, sacrosanct. asked dorden. zweil cried. zweil screamed. gaunt looked from one face to the next slowly. gaunt took off his cap and sat down. everyone was staring at him. zweil spat. he shook dorden's arm off him. gaunt shrugged. lugo? he's not lugo placed you with the tanith on hagia. you were meant to be my replacement. i was meant to be your judge and executioner. that was what lugo wanted of me. i'd like to think that i have proved myself to you and the ghosts since then. yes, lugo spoke to me when we arrived. i won't lie. he asked me to work on you. he thought you could persuade sabbat to relocate to morlond. gaunt nodded. �hlaine larkin, ghost if he'd learned anything about herodor so far, it was that the nights were fething cold.  the city shield was lit, and for that they might be somewhat thankful, but the wasteland wind, with a cutting edge like a chainsword, slid in under the canopy of energy and bit them to the bone. if larkin had understood his sergeant's pre-brief right the area the carriers had dropped them off in was called the glassworks, a ramshackle, two thousand hectare arrangement of dingy workshops, storebarns and manufactories in the northwest of the city. it seemed a long, long way from anywhere nice. the main bulk of the civitas, well-lit and cosy-looking, was a good distance behind them. here, the light of drumfires and phospha lamps combined with the gauzy glow of the shield overhead to produce a blue, submarine halflight. above, in the night sky, stars twinkled that were not stars. those indistinct pinpricks of light were the hundreds � possibly thousands � of pilgrim ships that had swarmed to herodor. larkin's platoon, number eleven, had been sent to the glassworks with ten and twelve to secure that section of perimeter. easy job, to say it. in practice, it was hard to even find the perimeter in the first place. the whole area had been overrun by pilgrims, and their tent towns had grown like forest fungus between the empty buildings � inside some of them, in fact � and out into the edges of the wasteland itself, beyond the limits of the crackling shield. there was no definable edge to the city at all. weapons slung, uneasy, the ghosts moved through the twilight world of the camp. the pilgrim contingent was huddled around feeble fires, cooking late meals or forming prayer circles. infardi worshippers in green silk were performing rituals around their clock shrines, or moving through the camp passing out pamphlets. many were tonsured or had their napes shaved, others hugged placards or emblems of the saint. the most extreme had pierced themselves with the stigmata of the nine wounds, or inscribed holy tracts on their skin. some had whips or sticks to scourge themselves with. every single one displayed his or her pilgrim badge proudly, and every one looked pinched and painfully cold. larkin hurried to catch up. just for the hell of it, he shouldered his long-las and panned the scope around. through the enhanced and magnifying viewfinder, he spot-picked locations in the fuzzy cold of the obsidae beyond the camp. for one brief second, he thought he glimpsed movement in the distance. just wind blowing the dust up. that's all, he told himself. not the enemy. as far as hlaine larkin � the regiment's finest marksman � was concerned, the enemy wasn't really out there anywhere. he was already inside the city, inside with them. and his name was lijah cuu. sir? mister? anton alphant turned and looked at her. he raised his arms so she could see his hands were empty. my apologies, sergeant. criid shrugged. she nodded. alphant affirmed with another quick nod, and then gently opened his robe so she could see what his hands were doing at all times. he pulled out his sheaf of certificates. registered infardi pilgrim. place of origin, khan ii, place of birth i got sidetracked, i'm afraid. i was just going to see if the doors on that manufactory were open. hwlan? get that place open, please. stylites, you know? gol kolea set his lasrifle down and thought hard. it was painful to watch. gol kolea had once been leader of tenth platoon, with a fine war record behind him. some said he was senior officer material. but on phantine, two years before, the spraying fragments of a loxatl flechette round had ripped into his head and torn away his wits and his personality. it was a crying shame, a real tragedy. kolea seldom said more than a few words. his last comment was a downright magnum opus. talks a lot of gak, don't you, gak-head? eh? eh? sure as sure. whoo, careful, mascot. said bonin, the twelfth platoon scout. cuu sniggered and wandered off. the manufactory interior was dark and empty, and smelled of woodrot, motor oil and ozone. nessa moved past him, scoping around with her long-las. dafelbe advanced with her, shining his lamp pack into the darker corners. there were holes in the roof over their heads, and through them, they could see the shifting luminescence of the city shield. alphant asked criid. she nodded. the pilgrims dragged belongings with them on barrows and litters, and some manhandled clock shrines in through the doorway. fires were laid. the pilgrims were singing a slow, pastoral hymn as they settled themselves. alphant moved amongst them, helping them get comfortable. criid watched him for a while. the man might not claim to be a leader, but he had a natural, reassuring air of command that the pilgrims all responded to. he was, however, clearly preoccupied, and kept looking at the door as newcomers entered. who was he hoping to find in the ironhall camp? criid was helping an elderly man find a corner to sit in. the old man had a handcart loaded with crudely painted plaster busts of the saint, undoubtedly copied cheaply and in bulk using a fabric replicator, which he sold to the faithful to keep himself in soup money. it was hideous. the paint had been applied so badly and so clumsily that saint sabbat looked like a pre-teen clangirl wannabe from vervunhive who had just that morning discovered cosmetics and applied them enthusiastically. it was a non-uniform garment, a fur-trimmed shadik army field jacket that she'd appropriated on aexe cardinal. she'd slit the insignia off. so far, no one had brought her up for wearing it, and she was glad of the warmth. she could hear raised voices coming from the factory entrance. problem? with a flick of her head, she signalled dafelbe and lubba to back off. lubba seemed curiously naked without his trademark flamer pack. the ghosts in eleven platoon had started moving the moment they heard the first shots, but they were met by a surge of panicking pilgrims rushing out of the camp area. two or three guardsmen were knocked off their feet by the moving crush. the initial bursts of enemy fire had appeared only as flashes of light in the distance behind the press of bodies, but now actual laser bolts were visible, bright and hard, searing over the heads of the crowd. hot red or hotter white, the lines of shots walked and bent like tracer rounds through the gloom. a series of them struck the warehouse wall behind obel's location and blew out thick chunks of plaster and brick. two loose rounds hit a stylite in the middle distance and knocked him, flailing, off his pillar. other shots arced down mercilessly into the terrified masses. obel cursed, down in cover behind a handcart with his voxofficer. the vox-man was shouting to be heard as he relayed the situation in. but they've got something heavier. that was what was doing the real harm. potent firepower, auto-cycle, indiscriminate. dozens of pilgrims were already dead. the heavy had so much kick, it brought down another of the hapless stylites by chopping clean through the pillar he was standing on. larkin observed with astonishment that the other pillar-dwellers didn't try to flee or climb down. obel yelled. larkin studied the play of las-bolts in the air, watching for the fat, dull red ones. about two hundred metres north and east. obel waved jajjo and unkin forward to partner larkin. jajjo, darkskinned and handsome, was eleven's new scout and the first vervunhiver to achieve promotion to that elite speciality. the trio pushed across the flow of the screaming crowd and hurried down a short flight of flagstone steps onto an arched walkway that ran along the back of a factory blockhouse.  several dozen pilgrims had elected to hide along here, and cowered into the walls as the three guardsmen ran past. the walkway reached a corner where it split, continuing on over a stone footbridge into the side of a fabrication mill or descending to the lower service street by a wooden staircase. pilgrims flooded along the street below. larkin stood at the top of the steps for a moment and cocked his head. they reached a cross street. the flow of pilgrims had ebbed. bodies sprawled all around on the rutted roadway. a clock shrine lay overturned at the junction. larkin darted out and got in cover behind the clock shrine immediately, the street lit up; light las-fire, hissing like quenched steel, and the heavy, diaphragm-vibrating belch of the cannon peppered, the carcass of the clock shrine shook and pieces of wood and plastic splintered off into the air. shots chopped into the street paving too, or thudded dully into the draped and hunched corpses. larkin kept his head down. the fusillade he'd stirred up was so intense there wasn't a chance of jajjo or unkin making it across to join him. they were still pinned around the corner. several cannon rounds came right through the twisted clock that sheltered him and missed his head by a short margin. larkin rolled and pulled his longlas up to his shoulder. prone, he had a very limited field of view under the shrine's cart base, but it was enough for him to slide his long-las through and clear the sights. the street beyond resolved in the cold, green shimmer of his night scope. he had to tweak the visual gain down because the las-flashes swooping his way were testing the limits of the radiance contrast. better. a hot spot. very hot. a superheated muzzle, something big. he looked again, identifying three shadows working a heavy cannon on a tripod behind a parked motor truck forty metres away. more hot spots, smaller, cooler. men with lasrifles. one in a doorway, another behind a row of fuel drums, another low against a side wall. all of them pumping fire at him. he reached back and opened his musette bag, pulling a handful of powerclips out and selecting a standard low volt cell. he did it all by touch, reading the difference between the upright and diagonal crosses of tape he'd marked the sides with. he'd have preferred to go with a hot-shot for maximum power, but there were too many targets. a hot-shot was a one-use cell and he didn't have the time to keep changing between hits. larkin popped the hot-shot clip out of the long-las and replaced it with a low volt. he made sure he had a green armed tell-tale showing on the backsight, and then snuggled in. feth, but they weren't letting up. another minute, no more, and the clock shrine would start falling apart and he might as well be naked in the middle of the street with a target painted on his face and a feather up his arse. the cannon was the obvious initial target, but the noise it was whooping out would cover him as he picked off the others first. he set on the shooter in the doorway, waited for him to blaze away again to pick him out of the shadows properly, and then fired. the enemy probably didn't even see his muzzle flash in the confusion. the one by the side wall now. that's it, keep shooting. show me right where you are� the long-las kicked. the figure by the wall flopped over. the shooter by the drums suddenly realised that his cronies were down. he started to run back towards the cannon. that was when larkin put his third shot through the man's spine. the cannon started to crank up and fire right at him instead of hosing the street. no time for chances. larkin ejected the low volt and slammed a hotshot home. each blast of the cannon had many times more power than the long-las, even with a hot-shot in the pipe, and it was cycling them out at a rate of five a second. the clock part of the toppled shrine disintegrated and a wheel went spinning off the cart, dismembered and shedding spokes. yeah, larkin yelled, reloading and getting up. jajjo and unkin swept out of cover and started running past him, snapping off semi-auto bursts to wash the street. said unkin, surveying the sniper's handiwork as he got into a covering position at the next corner, near to where the destruction of the cannon had made a burning crater in the roadway. he was crouching beside the truck and had begun firing down the left hand street. more assaulters were moving up towards them. lots of them. and jajjo recognised their blood-red uniforms at once. blood pact. so it was true, tona criid thought to herself. up to a point, at least. what corbec's briefing had omitted was the scale. this wasn't a skirmish raid. this was a full-on assault. the enemy was pouring out of the wasteland into the glassworks sector in force, heavily serviced by infantry support weapons and portable shields. by her own estimate, fifty or more pilgrims had been slaughtered in the opening phase, caught between the ruthless shock-fire of the attackers and the virtually helpless imperials. now the pilgrims had mostly fled into cover nearby, or en masse up into the inner city, and the battle had opened up, a ferocious street-fight running up through the obsidae, the camps and into the manufactories in the zone. criid's platoon, supported by domor's, held a three block area, with obel's unit not far away to their west. she was reinforced fifteen minutes into the fight by three more platoons transitting in from the east, and by the column of local warriors voxed up by captain lamm. it was ugly, as ugly as anything she'd ever known, and that was saying something. it felt a little like the street war she'd been caught up in back at vervunhive, but there the enemy had been the well-equipped but drone-like zoicans. the blood pact were a different thing altogether. they knew how to fight the streets. they were as skilled as the ghosts and more disciplined than any chaos force she'd ever encountered. it also compared unfavorably with the trench war on aexe cardinal that they'd only recently left behind. at the time, she'd believed that to be the benchmark of bad in terms of combat.  trapped � like rats and with rats � in narrow, filthy dugouts, sometimes fighting hand to hand. but this was a gakking nightmare. the glassworks was too open, too meandering. every corner and twist of walkway, every sub-alley and back run, was a death trap. in a trench, you at least knew the enemy was in front of you. laughing, she burst off a spray of las-shots and slammed a blood pacter backwards through an archway. two more appeared, and she felled them both as well. report! don' cuu squealed. he shouted. two streets away, mortar rounds were falling on the sheds and factory spaces. seething sheets of flame rushed out of doorways and windows, spraying glass into the air and shaking the earth. a roof caved in. two long assembly shops were ablaze. milo cowered in the cover of a half-fallen wall. his ears rang with overpressure. blood from a shrapnel wound dribbled down his cheek. bonin suddenly hissed, and rolled over, bringing his lasrifle up. he cracked off a couple of rounds and milo joined his efforts. red-dad figures had just emerged from the bombed-out buildings ahead of them. they fired with care and precision. bonin, a hugely able scout, had been trained in warfare by mkoll, and knew how to shoot and how to wait to shoot. milo had learned his battle-craft from a variety of sources� colonel corbec, gaunt himself and, most especially, hlaine larkin. milo picked his targets with a huntsman's expertise. between them, they shot down nine blood pact attackers as they emerged from the ruins and tried to push down the street. the abandoned barn criid had opened for alphant's faithful just a short while before was now riven with flames. many of those inside were too old or infirm to save themselves. or they were children, helplessly lost and terrified. milo and bonin went back in with alphant and shooed the screaming children out. rafters came down in scuds of flame. bonin and alphant grabbed an old woman in a litter seat and struggled out with her, patting out the flames which had caught on her dress. milo grabbed up two small children and scrambled them through into the night air.  outside, they were met by a rain of las-fire and hard rounds. the blood pact had caught up with them. the old woman bonin and alphant had carried to safety died in her chair. milo couldn't bear to look at the other casualties. he and bonin dragged their las rifles off their shoulders and began returning fire, using the masonry of a disintegrated store front as a barricade. alphant yelled from cover in a doorway, children huddled around him. milo fetched out his laspistol and threw it to alphant. then he chucked over some spare dips from his musette bag. the three of them began to fire down the street. ducking in and out and shooting, alphant suddenly saw the girl, sabbatine. he'd been looking for her all night� ever since their encounter in the ironhall camp, in fact. there was something about the girl, something remarkable, something that had driven him to seek her out. she came out of a lathe shop down the street, rushing a group of child pilgrims from a block where flames were leaping up. they ran in line, holding hands. alphant shouted out to her. milo exclaimed, seeing them come. las-fire whipped around the heads of the little, urgent procession. how was it missing? how were they not dead? alphant yelled at the girl. she seemed to be making no effort to duck or keep low. he risked his own skin and ran out of cover to grab her and the last of the children. a shot grazed his thigh. somehow, the tiny girl kept him upright until they tumbled back into shelter. sabbatine smiled. milo crawled over to them, urging the sobbing children to stay low, trying to make it sound like a game. she looked over at him and milo was lost for words. he'd never seen her before in his life, but he knew her. as if he'd always known her. milo shook himself to clear the distraction from his mind. bonin yelled from nearby, in amongst the cowering kids and other pilgrims himself. the fire's choked off the back end of the street. sparkfilled coils of smoke washed across the trashed, shot-up accessway. he saw men moving up through it men with rifles and chilling iron masks. every few seconds, one or more raised his weapon and fired in their direction. far too many for just the three of them to repel. then even that became academic. the advancing blood pact infantry were drawing aside into the edges of the ruined street. something was approaching from behind them. zweil waggled his bony hands in frustration. the voice came from behind him. kilosh returned the gesture. zweil drew kilosh to one side and lowered his voice. neither do i, as it goes. but you're afraid i'll go in there and denounce her to her face. kilosh studied zweil's face for a long moment, then beckoned him to follow. the civitas beati regimentals drew back the bronze doors, and the two old priests hobbled into the vast chancel of the great church. the marble walls and pillars were laced with gilt, and obsidian mosaics had been chased into the stone facings. clock shrines had been clustered inside the entrance, along with glacial heaps of islumbine garlands. a massive, sculptural eagle wrought from black iron, thirty metres from wingtip to wingtip, was suspended from the domed roof. the deep rows of pews, arranged in a semi-circle fan, were made of a dark, varnished wood and, at the high altar, great candlesticks worked from gleaming chelon shell fluttered with yellow flame. the altar itself was a large, rectangular basin of stone, filled with holy water from the balneary. the water was smooth and unrippled, like a brown mirror. zweil knelt and made devotion for a moment facing the altar. then kilosh helped him back to his feet and led him through to the inner chapel. esholi handmaids, robed in violet albs and white bicom headdresses, waited outside the gilded screen of the iconostasis.  kilosh opened the old screen door and the pair descended the few, worn steps into the tiny crypt. it was dark, save for phospha lamps and a shaft of faint exterior light swirling with the glow of the city shield, that fell through a narrow slit high up the wall above the simple shrine altar. a woman was kneeling there, in prayer, the window light dipping onto her. she heard them and rose, turning. she wore long, blue robes and a white stole, and her glossy black hair was tied up away from her face. kilosh bowed at once zweil stared at her, unable to express himself. islumbine. he could smell islumbine strongly on the air. he gasped and fell to his knees. he took it between his own. something thrilled through his skin, like an electric charge. like needles. he broke the grip sharply and looked up at her, confused. her smile had not faded. he said, struggling to his feet. he was blinking hard, as if trying not to cry. damn you, zweil! with all my heart, kilosh, i meant what i said back there. but now i see the truth. kilosh angrily pulled at zweil's sleeve to drag him back. the imhava ayatani pushed him away. the tank fired again, burying a shell in the facade of the burning manufactory behind them. rock and glass was hurled into the air. the children and the pilgrims were screaming. bonin yelled. milo bawled back, shielding his head from the fluttering debris. another shell howled over their heads. the tank was just twenty metres off now. its hardpoint stubber started chattering, raking the rubble barricade. the two ghosts started to run in opposite directions, heads down. bonin hurtled down the left side of the roadway, tight to the wall, trying to strap the tube-charges together as he ran. milo crossed to the right side, went on hands and knees until he reached a doorway, and then flopped round. he swung up out of hiding and let rip with his lasrifle on full auto. the shots pinged and flashed against the bruised metal hull of the war machine. it lurched to a stop and then the stubber came round to aim at him. he barely got down in time. the hefty, solid-slug weapon blew the wall and doorway over his curled up body into fragments. it wasn't enough. he hadn't distracted it for anything like long enough for bonin to get close. milo started to crawl again as more flurries of shrieking stub rounds went over him. if only he could� he heard alphant shouting and looked up. the girl was running from cover. running into the middle of the warwounded street, right out in front of the tank. captain! dorden? the tanith reinforcements leapt out of their transports the moment the column of trucks pulled up. they'd reached a crossroads on principal i, facing north on the guild slope, where the southern boundary of the ironhall and glassworks sectors began. one by one, light tanks and self-propelled guns of the regiment civitas beati powered past, moving up to the front line, along with salamanders and light cannon-platforms from lugo's landing force. gaunt checked his bolt-pistol clip and walked the length of one of the stationary troop carriers to where corbec was briefing squad leaders. kilosh was shouting. zweil pointed across the chapel at the saint, who watched him with reproachful silence. zweil, his head pulsing, was about to reply when he felt a smoky, rusty tang in his mouth. he looked at kilosh and coughed. oh my dear lord emperor, zweil thought this is it.  i'm having a stroke and � and that was all he thought. kilosh said, more mystified than anything else. he stooped beside his elderly colleague, felt for a pulse and started to call for help. there was a shriek from behind him. he turned to see that the saint had fallen to her knees. in the light of the phospha lamps, he saw a frightened, horrified look on her face. her shaking hands were dabbing at the blood streaming from her nose. milo! milo! i know what i saw then. �zweil, ayatani from the streets of the guild slope in mid-city, a nimbus of russet-pink and yellow could be seen suffusing the darkness over the north-west skirts of the metropolitan area. individual sparks of light flickered in that blanket glow like grounded lightning. dull booms and roars, pent in by the acoustic lid formed by the city shield, rolled back to their ears, and smoke, similarly trapped by the shield, collected into a wispy roof like low cloud. according to the now frenetic reports of civitas tac logis, over a thousand hostiles, with supporting armour, were assaulting the city. and the city was falling. partly under the fury of the attack, and partly beneath the weight of an inexplicable sense of defeat and loss that had settled over the population during the hours of the night. viktor hark could not account for it, but he could feel it. an ache, a feeling of disillusion, a sapping misery. perhaps it was the unexpected speed and ferocity of the chaos onslaught. perhaps it was a general realisation of how fragile the imperial position really was. even in his worst-case contemplations of disaster, gaunt had never expected things to go so badly wrong so rapidly. hark knew that as a certainty. he'd spent considerable time with gaunt, risk-assessing the woeful defensive opportunities afforded by the civitas beati, the far from adequate numerical strengths at their disposal, the complete lack of preparation time. it was a bleak picture, and gaunt had made no secret of his fear that once the archenemy's main force arrived, the fight for herodor would be as good as done. but that main force had still to reach herodor, and yet the city already seemed close to collapsing in one night. hark sighed when he heard this and tugged the micro-bead from his ear. he didn't want to listen anymore. the streets were dogged, by people and by lamentation. that was it. this was not the sound of terror and alarm rising from the crowds. this was the sound of woe. hark was riding in a heavy-fendered troop transporter near the front of a reinforcement column. there were twelve transporters, all identical grey, long-bodied munitorum vehicles, and they were only making any headway through the crowds at all because of the three chimera heavies from the lord general's life company that were leading them through. the sight of tracked armour made the distressed crowds part sharply. colonel kaldenbach, lugo's field commander, had command of the column, and the tanith and herodian pdf squads in the troop carriers answered to him. hark knew kaldenbach fairly well from his time on the lord general's staff, an uncompromising but gifted officer who had crowned a good career in the ardelean colonials with elevation to lugo's personal life company. the column turned west off principal ii, under the broad aqueducts that serviced the agriponic district, and rolled into the wide plaza of astronomer's circle in the shadow of the great volcanic plug on which sat the astronomer's platform, that bastion of herodian science and learning. it was up there, in the ancient observatories that had been operating permanently for over two thousand years, that cazalon had devised and written his treatise on non-baryonic matter and hazmun zeng, three centuries later, had doggedly completed his theory of gravitation in the face of fierce inquisitorial displeasure. hark had been told that it was possible to visit zeng's workshop study, which had been preserved, by order of the first officiary, exactly as the great man had left it. the idea appealed to hark immensely. to climb the steps rough-hewn in the side of the rock plug up into that quiet little island of observatories, macroscope towers, sidereal calculators and libraries high above the murmur of the city and spend a few quiet moments in the dusty room where zeng had made such a staggering contribution to imperial science, filling notebooks with mirror-script to fool the watching eyes of the inquisition. but war, as ever, anchored hark to the ground. in twenty years, he had travelled to and served on over forty worlds, many of them rich with cultural treasures and sites of significance. he had never enjoyed the indulgence of visiting any of them. there was always fighting to be done, or battle orders to review and, when that was over, a troop-ship waiting to convey him to the next theatre. the column drew up in the circle and the units disembarked. kaldenbach, sturdy in his long green coat and cap, marched the line of assembly, issuing orders. there were fifty troopers from lugo's life company in the support force, all of them dad in heavy green fatigues and camo-helms. a major called pento from the regiment civitas beati was in charge of the herodian portion, two platoons of civitas beati elite and five of regular herodian pdf. sergeant varl drew up the ghost element of five platoons: his own, haller's, arcuda's, raglon's and ewler's. hark felt somewhat surplus to requirements. kaldenbach even had his own commissars, an inseparable pair of identical twins called keetle. they were thin, bony redheads with fair skin and thyroid eyes, dressed in black, patent leather stormcoats that creaked as they strode along, singing out incendiary and fortifying mottoes in stereo. bad form, in hark's book. the assembling soldiers were clearly spooked. they were on the doorstep of a savage urban fight zone and about to go in head first, and around them lay a city that seemed to have already given up. yelled keetle one. hark asked. hark laughed, but he could tell from varl's manner something was bothering him. corbec, rawne or daur dead. any of those things would be a critical blow to the tanith morale. hark asked. he looked over at kaldenbach who, with the ubiquitous keetles, was now addressing the lord general's life company troopers. they walked over to the colonel's side. kaldenbach asked. handsome man in his fifties with clean-cut features and wiry grey hair. kaldenbach frowned. this, an unwelcome reference to gaunt's unusual and unpopular dual status, was a thinly veiled dig. hark smiled and nodded. kaldenbach looked coldly at varl, and the keetles whispered darkly to each other. we will stand to until word is given. the ghost force surged forward across the paved circle, dressing their camo-cloaks, and melted into the narrow streets beyond. pento, the herodian officer, watched them disappear. the last thing he or any of his men wanted to do was rush prematurely into combat. not, it seemed, like the off-worlders in black. the scrivener's office ruptured and collapsed, all eight storeys of it. dust and fire flushed out from the avalanche of masonry, and the men of five platoon ran for cover. squat, robust, one-eyed and nothing like as mobile as his younger troopers, agun soric threw himself flat and the dust flow rushed over him like a breaker. vivvo's voice rang through the billowing smoke soric pulled himself up. even so, soric didn't object as vivvo steadied him. vivvo yelled, and the scattered elements of five platoon came out of cover. the street was a mess. white rubble covered the cobbles and most of the buildings on the west side of the road were ablaze. soric hobbled forward, sending hand signals to fan his beleaguered troopers out. then he sat his wide rump down on a slab of alabaster, took off his mask and spat. kazel, mallor and venar suddenly switched round, rifles aimed, as they picked up movement south of them. soric urged, as sergeant meryn's platoon ran up to join them out of the drifting smoke. meryn was a young, slickly handsome tanith with more front than the entire fething crusade. it was said rawne was grooming him, and that, soric believed, explained why the previously amiable meryn had become such a hardboiled bastard of late. he was openly ambitious in all the wrong ways, and there were dirty rumours that during the insurgency mission on phantine, he'd exposed a cruel, almost psychotic side to his character. it was said he'd murdered civilians. soric didn't know about that, and didn't want to, and there was no arguing with the pretty boy's combat record. but of all the squads he could have meshed with, meryn's was about last on the list, save rawne's platoon, of course. and then there was the matter of that ridiculously sinister moustache meryn had been cultivating. trooper guheen hurried up, a compact missile tube slung over one shoulder. guheen and coreas soric bellowed, running forward. he slammed into hefron from his own squad, and wrenched the tread fether out of his bemused hands. how the feth did you know? move it up! he held out a crumpled ball of flimsy blue paper. meryn demanded. meryn unballed the paper and read it : guheen's going to get himself pulped if he goes that way. the tank is behind the cabinet maker's shop. the periscope was powerful but small enough to slip into the chart-pocket of his fatigues. he slid the business end round the fractured brick corner and took a squint. fifty metres down the rubble-strewn main street, a stalk-tank sat in the centre of the roadway, its weapon pods pointing in their direction. rawne curled his lip in annoyance. identity? udol asked. it's blood pact all right. trained, tight, wellsupported and systematic. their handiwork identifies them. strangely, it was as if the whole city sensed that too. as if its heart had been torn out, as if it felt as lost and despairing as he did himself. corbec hadn't been able to explain it, but gaunt had seen other troopers in the vicinity similarly upset for no apparent reason at the very same moment. and the vox traffic had been abruptly flooded with anguished calls of dismay. that had been the moment the mood had truly crashed. corbec had pulled himself together, and they'd pressed into the zone. the last time gaunt had seen his number two, corbec was shaken and uneasy, leading his platoon off down a smoke-hazed sidestreet. everything shook as two tank rounds hit home nearby. the fabricatory rocked and dust spattered down from the ceiling. gaunt checked the box-mag of his bolt pistol, and clambered across the rubble to where troopers lyse and derin were guarding a doorway. they were both pinking the occasional shot out of the broken entrance with their lasrifles. gaunt whispered, crouching behind them. lyse raised a dusty hand and indicated some features of the fire-lit battlefield outside for her commander's benefit. lyse nodded. on phantine, she'd become the first female trooper to become squad flamer, and was proud of that role. a tough, broad-shouldered verghastite in her late thirties, lyse preferred to wear her black vest top to show off arms that were as well muscled as any male's. like all the tanith flame-troopers, she missed her speciality weapon, and so did gaunt. a few spurts of an imperial standard man-portable flamer mk viii would have cooked the blood pact now edging up to their position in the blindside of the building. beside them, derin started firing more urgently. a few figures in redbrown battledress had emerged from behind the burning vehicle wreck outside and were attempting to rush the side wall. lyse began shooting too, and gaunt scrunched forward on his knees and added his own firepower to the repulse. lasrifle shots and bolt rounds rattled out from the doorway. one of the figures simply fell over and vanished in the rubble another jerked back dramatically in mid-stride. the rest ran back for cover. gaunt asked. caober shrugged. beltayn turned to distribute instructions when the hab was struck squarely by a shell that blew a section of wall in on them and killed two members of first platoon. a shrieking whoop, a blitzing, gritty fireburst and then everyone still alive was picking themselves up in the choking smoke. gaunt could hear heavy assault fire from outside. over the micro-bead he heard derin. gaunt knew there'd be no retreating now. domor shook his head. the ground above them shook with the heavy shelling. even short-range micro-beads were only barely making it. corbec saw criid lying on a pile of sacking nearby. kolea and lubba were with her. head wound. nothing too bad. corbec could see that for himself. it was ugly and going to get a lot uglier before daylight. there were civilians down here too. in one corner, corbec saw several adults trying to comfort a group of terrified children. everyone was black with ash-soot. he wandered over. the adults with the kids were all civvies, pilgrims by the look of them. bonin was standing nearby, leaning his tired body against a wall and sipping from his water bottle. bonin nodded. brinny boy? corbec put the rest together. corbec paused. i could feel it like on hagia, you know? she saved the children and then she died. it wasn't meant to happen. i can feel it wasn't. corbec didn't reply. he lifted the corner of the sacking. the girl was very peaceful and very dead. just a young girl, another victim of the endless war. he laid the sacking back. from outside came the rattle of small-arms close by. domor, bonin and the other able-bodied troops in the basement shelter grabbed up their weapons and headed for the exit. straight silver! beltayn was yelling. it wasn't the only breach. the hab reverberated with the clash of hand-tohand combat as blood pact storm-squads burst in through window lights, doorways and shell holes, driving first platoon backwards into the ruins. it was a killing frenzy, the malevolent, red-hot heart of pure war. the smokefilled chamber, murky and firelit like daemon hell, was thick with screams, blows, spraying shots and thrashing figures. they were enveloped in chaos. gaunt's bolt pistol was spent. there were spare mags in his belt-pouches, but absolutely no chance of reloading in the turmoil. he let it go and wrenched out his tanith warknife plunging into the nearest enemy trooper with both blades. blood soaked his jacket and his cloak so much the cloth slapped heavily around him. he realised he was screaming wordless sounds of rage at the swarming enemy. they stank. they brought their abattoir reek with them: foul breath, sour sweat, dried blood and the noxious aroma of the oils and paints with which they anointed their bodies. the sword of sondar split a black-iron visor in two. blood sizzled off the charged blade. gaunt's warknife hacked into a throat. something knocked his cap off. a blood pact trooper crashed sideways into him and staggered him, but the wretch was already dead. then a laser round clipped the top of gaunt's left shoulder and knocked him to his knees. he put the power sword through the armoured thighs in front of him, and was flattened as the severed bodyweight toppled forward onto him. beltayn had lost his lasgun. he snatched up a fallen billhook and slammed it with both hands into the nearest enemy sternum, then leapt forward and grabbed gaunt by the shoulders, trying to drag him to his feet. beltayn yelled in gaunt's face. the colonel-commissar didn't even seem to recognise him. he was dripping with gore. beltayn repeated, his throat raw from the smoke. gaunt shoved him out of the way and butchered another blood pacter who was surging at them. the power sword cut him in two and cracked stone chips out of the pillar beside him. an explosion knocked them all off their feet. masonry rubble rained down from the roof and the end wall of the hab fell like a stack of child's playbricks.  cold air washed in, thick with the smell of fyceline, and contorted the dense smoke around them into weird eddies and gusting coils. sword still clamped in one blood-smeared hand, gaunt grabbed beltayn by the arm and dragged him towards the caved section of wall. vanette and starck followed them, backing their way, emptying the last of their power cells from the hip as they went. there was no sign of any other member of first, just dark red figures scrambling through the smoke at their heels. the four men fell out down the mound of rubble into the open. las-shots sizzled out of the hab building after them. they were in the wide concourse of hazgul square itself. the whole area was on fire. buildings, reduced to hollow shells by the firestorm, spurting flames and sparks from their blind windows. three tanks � one imperial light and two enemy models � were burning where they had died. bodies littered the ground, half-covered by the ash falling like snow from the boiling smoke. the heat was so fierce it felt like a summer noon on caligula. there was no way of telling where anything or anyone was. it was as if they had washed up in the middle of the apocalypse. gaunt recovered his wits enough for his hands to start to tremble. his heart was banging like an autoloader. limping from a wound he couldn't remember receiving, he hurried the other three across the twenty metres of open square to the nearest cover. it was a burned-out rcb troop carrier. gaunt cried, and then realised the lack of response was because his micro-bead was no longer in his ear. its snapped flex dangled from his collar dip. he looked at the other three. all of them were covered in dirt and blood and multiple minor wounds. vanette's jacket was shredded and blood streamed down his right forearm from a wound at his elbow. starck had his head in his hands, shaking with nervous energy and adrenaline. both still had their lasrifles. beltayn's grazed, cut hands were empty. he sat with his back against the troop carrier wreck, staring out at the firestorms with the blank look of a man who had reached his limits. micro-bead, then? beltayn? beltayn! starck! starck had lost his � lost the entire holster, in fact � but vanette unshipped his laspistol and slid it across the rockcrete to gaunt. gaunt sheathed his sword and ducked down by the buckled rear wheel, taking shots at the main advance. by the counter display on the pistol's butt, he had about thirty shots left before the cell expired. thirty shots. the fire they were receiving was getting heavier. both infantry fronts were targeting the troop carrier, and the stalk-tank had begun to spit cyclic pulses at them. the wreck rattled and shook, and actually moved more than once under the impacts. bodywork casing fragmented off into the air. beltayn howled out as a piece of shrapnel tore into his arm. vanette's cheek was scorched by spall bursting from a hull-strike. any moment now, gaunt knew, a tank round or a rocket grenade would finish them off. not by any stretch of the imagination. four chimeras, displaying the insignia of the lord general's life company, stormed into the square, crashing through burning buildings with their toothed dozer blades. they were moving fast, their hulls rocking back on their treads as they accelerated out of the rubble. in their top turrets, troopers manned the autocannons, blazing tracer fire into the air. behind the fast, armoured carriers, lumbering tanks emerged. civitas beati armour, pdf lights and two life company vanquishers. they began firing as soon as they had visual target on the enemy vanguard. flooding in around the vehicle charge were troopers, many carrying company banners, flags and aquila standards on long poles. leading the ground troops with a standard clenched in one hand, gaunt could see marshal biagi. he was striding forward at the head of a dozen officers of the regiment civitas. they were razing the ground before them with their flamer packs. the four ghosts crawled under the wreck for safety as shells and heavy cannon fire whipped over their heads in both directions. the noise and concussion were physically painful.  from where he lay, gaunt could see biagi directing the ground forces forward. someone, lugo himself most probably, had mobilised all the reserves into this counter-push. the damn fool! if this failed, there would be nothing, absolutely nothing, left to defend the inner hives with. gaunt knew lugo was hardly the most gifted tactician ever to emerge from officer candidate scholam, but this was an act of madness even by his dismal standards. already this night they had been surprised at the sheer scale of the advance force the archenemy had managed to land on herodor. who was to say that another force of equal size wasn't now waiting to strike at the southern agriponic zone, or another poised in the eastern obsidae? what would lugo do then, if his entire military strength was committed here? it was madness. it was� � it was madness, but not the kind gaunt supposed. he blinked. something odd was happening. every sound was dulling, everything in sight beginning to shimmer. shards of glass on the floor under his bloodied hands twinkled like diamonds. the scabby metal of the tailgate above his head looked like mother of pearl. tank shells slid overhead in perfect clarity, leaving slow billows in their wake, the smoke turning and spiralling into perfect double-helix trails. everything seemed to slow down. feth! for a moment ibram gaunt thought he'd been shot. he felt no pain, no impact, but he'd heard invalided veterans describe the way really bad wounds happened without you knowing it, turning the world into a slow motion wonderland as your failing senses registered the simple, profound splendour in everything. there was a light in his eyes. a golden light. a life company salamander, squat and heavy on its tracks, rolled up into his view, coming to a halt just a few metres from where he lay under the wrecked carrier. a figure stood upright in its open-topped cabin. she was beautiful. she wore a suit of intricately-worked golden battle armour so fine and form-fitting that it had been clearly fashioned for her by master metallurgists. pieces of polished chelon shell had been set into the bodice and wide pauldrons. imperial eagles formed the couters at the elbows and the poleyns at the knees, and the same symbol was also etched in repeated ribbons down the thigh plates and along the vambraces. her left hand was covered with a gilded glove that had silver eagle claws extending from the fingertips. her right hand was bare. beneath the dazzling golden plate, she wore a suit of tightly-wound black mail, each link formed in the shape of an islumbine bloom. a white skirt, long and flowing and fixed with purity seals and prayer streamers, billowed from her waist. the heavy golden gorget rose up high to her chin, but her head was uncovered. she'd cut her hair short, sheared it off crudely in fact, so it fell in a glossy black bowl over her pale head. her eyes were green, as green as an infardi's silk, as green as the rainwoods of hagia. the beati looked down at gaunt. a halo of light surrounded her, so fierce and bright it made her seem almost translucent. nine cyber-skull drones hovered around her in the radiant glow, forming a circle behind her head, their eyes lit, their miniature weapon pods armed. she was terrible to behold. she smiled. he realised he was weeping, but he didn't care. she raised her arms wide. a green cloak unfurled from her back and became wings. a perfect aquila form spread out around her, five metres on either side, not silk but shimmering green light. behind her head, the doubleheads of the imperial eagle clacked and hissed, encircled by the skull drones. gaunt got to his feet. he was so intent on her he knocked his head against the rear fender of the carrier, but his eyes didn't waver from the vision before him. he drew his sword and held it out to her, grip first. it was slender, silver and well over a metre long. islumbine garlands were looped around the hilt and jewelled pendants dangled from the pommel. gaunt asked. she raised the sword and pointed it at the enemy. the unseen driver slammed the salamander forward but she didn't even stir. on either side, imperial warriors surged forward towards the recoiling foe. flamers hissed, cannons barked, lasguns cracked and the heavy tank guns roared. the imperial banners fluttered. sword in hand, gaunt ran after her.   � saint sabbat, epistles there were crowds everywhere. it was barely daybreak, but the streets were packed. teeming masses of chanting pilgrims, celebrating soldiers and rejoicing citizens dogged the transitways and boulevards of the civitas beati, united in a raucous and unstinting expression of triumph. the wounded city had woken up to find it was, miraculously, still alive. wide slicks of black smoke stained the early daylight, wiping deep smudges across the flat cold whiteness of the sky. outlying northern sectors of the city were still-burning ruins littered with wrecked war machines and the uncounted bodies of the dead. an early estimate suggested hundreds of military personnel and citizens had perished. the pilgrim community had suffered the most. thousands had not made it through the gruelling night. but the body count and the serious destruction inflicted on the civitas seemed to bother no one in the crowd. they were as abnormally excited now as they had been inexplicably deflated in the small hours of the night. easy to explain perhaps, for humans are simple things : they were alive, they had won, and they were rejoicing in that fact. the greatest concentration of people was mobbing in around beati plaza, hundreds of thousands of exhilarated human beings, all of them chanting and whooping and dancing and cheering. banners were flapping in the dawn air, white petals swirling like confetti from the garlands the people wore soldiers, their grinning teeth white against the caked dirt on their faces, were hugged and kissed, and lifted up on shoulders. drums pounded. the ancient prayer horns of the city boomed fabricatory sirens wailed. people had got up on roofs and balconies, or waved eagerly from upper floor windows. streamers and fireworks flashed in the sky. on several street corners approaching the plaza, infardi preachers had climbed up onto the carts of their clock shrines and were leading prayers and hymn singing. eccesiarchy processions, led by choirs, carried reliquaries from the hive shrines through the streets. ministorum workers scattered petals and flower heads harvested at random from the agriponic farms. by the time gaunt reached the heaviest crowds in the plaza area, he had garlands of islumbine and irridox around his neck, and had been kissed and hugged more times than he could count. his clothes were ragged and torn and he was covered in cuts and bruises. he still carried the aquila standard that he'd picked up from a fallen rcb trooper in the thick of the fighting before daybreak. he felt strange, dazed, dislocated. the noise of the jubilation around him seemed louder and more oppressive than the bitter warfare of the night.  everything felt like a dream, but that was just his fatigue, he was sure. on the cold, flinty plain of the great western obsidae, as dawn came up, he had helped undertake the extinction of the enemy forces. there had been no quarter, and that was all right, for the blood pact were devoted and sworn servants of the archenemy of mankind. but they had slaughtered them. all of them. the glass fields beyond the city's north-western perimeter were scattered with corpses and with the smouldering hulls of fighting vehicles. faced with the beati, and with the renewed vigour she had inspired in the warriors of the imperium, the blood pact had snapped and run. biagi and kaldenbach, the acknowledged victors of the fight, had led the pursuit and annihilated the enemy in the obsidae now the winds of the ice-desert, gusting in over the western ramparts, would shrivel the blood pact bodies, and the ground frost freeze-dry their flesh, and they would remain as fragile mummies amidst the litter of their ruined armour, a testimony to the brutal zeal of an imperial army inspired by faith. gaunt reached the plaza. the crowds were packed fifty deep, but they parted to let him through. pilgrims and citizens reached out to touch him or to clap him on the shoulders. he was limping and using the banner for support. gaunt glanced around and was almost knocked over by raglon's enthusiastic hug of a greeting. raglon cried. gaunt smiled a tired smile. raglon's excitement was contagious. too seldom had he seen his men filled with the simple joy of victory. raglon nodded eagerly. raglon turned and looked towards the centre of the plaza. gaunt looked at the saint as raglon pulled away, laughing. she seemed to be staring directly at him. feygor laughed. she patted him on the arm. around them, the crowd was going mad with chants. he breathed, kissing her cheek and neck. he raised a hand and gently touched the bandage around her head. yeah, yeah yes, i suppose so. she's amazing. scoffed mkoll dryly. the vast crowd around them suddenly sent up a booming cheer and the ghosts in their midst joined in. larkin stared. it was like he had her in his crosshairs and she had him the same. if it had been a kill-sight, it would have been tough. ninety metres, with a crosswind and hundreds of cheering bodies between him and her. but he'd have made it. larkin was sure. and even more sure that she'd have made it too. the way she looked at him. like a marksman. hark pushed through the crowd. beside them, sergeant varl had climbed up on a clock shrine cart and started to dance, putting on a beret plumed with struthid feathers and pulling it down comically over his ears. vivvo handed soric the brass message shell. the crowd around them was going crazy. the cheering was so loud it was making him twitchy. soric undid the shell's cap and used his fingers as tweezers to fish the note out. it said: it's you she's looking at. she knows. soric dropped the paper scrap and pushed the message shell into his pocket. a moment later and vivvo re-emerged from the bustling crowd. he held out a message shell. soric patted his pant pockets. they were empty. vivvo handed him the shell and turned away. he glanced back over his shoulder. soric knew vivvo was catching on. soric opened the shell. this one said: tell gaunt. nine are coming. nine are coming. the handwriting was hasty. really rushed and badly formed, like he'd been writing in a hurry. despite the celebration around him, soric felt his heart sink. the little glade was quiet. it was a spring morning, early, the first rays of sunlight gleaming through the leaves. a vague mist covered the path to the chapel door. each step he took sounded too loud in the cool silence. there were no birds singing. that seemed odd. his boots crunched on the stone pavers. his pulse was racing. there was nothing to be afraid of, but he was afraid anyway. why was that? he wanted to be here. he wanted to go inside, but his heart was thumping. he reached the door. dew glittered on the iron handle. he reached out to take hold of it, but the door began to open of its own accord. it began to open and behind it he saw � gaunt woke with a start. he had to fight to catch his breath. the room around him was dark and over-warm. he had no idea what time it was. he got up off the bed and started to walk towards the windows to open the shutters. only then did he feel the terrible aches of his tired body. every step was painful. he opened a shutter, and white light shafted into the small chamber. outside it was late afternoon, and the sweep of the cityscape below showed that the celebration was still going on.  he could see banners, the occasional spark of a firework, and crowds still streaming along the narrow streets. he fiddled with the climate control vents built into the window sill, but no amount of jiggling eased the oppressive heat. he wished he could open the chamber window, but it was a hermetically sealed unit. this level of hive tower three was too high above the city shield and the civitas' atmosphere envelope. gaunt tried to remember the dream he'd been having. it had been so vivid, but it had melted away the moment he woke. aexe cardinal. he had been back on aexe cardinal, at the chapel. more than that, he couldn't say. he caught sight of his own reflection in the heavy dressing mirror in the corner of the room. he was dressed only in his under shorts, and his lean, muscled flesh looked unnaturally pale and white. the dark furrows of old scars looked like relief features on the surface of a chalky moon, especially the long, ugly rip across his belly that dercius had left him with so many years before. the newer wounds, the ones herodor had given him, were more livid. so many abrasions and scratches he didn't care to count, scabbing black with blood. bruises too, dark black and sickly yellow. the most serious were the las-burn across the top of his left shoulder and the gash in his right calf. lesp had cleaned him up pretty well, dressed the worst and sutured a few of the deepest cuts. he limped out of the bedchamber into the outer room. sorry, sir. i should have knocked. gaunt finished buttoning his jacket and started to look around for his cap. rerval reached into the musette bag he was carrying. rerval produced a brand new laspistol in a black leather holster. he buckled on his sheathed sword and warknife too and then put on his cap. then he paused. he felt ashamed to admit it. gaunt took the trademark tanith garment and nodded his thanks. rerval's gift was astonishingly generous, given how fiercely the tanith protected their knives and capes. long night, ban. daur smiled reassuringly. gaunt shook his head. he didn't feel much like hobnobbing with lugo's officer cadre he looked across at daur. he passed another data-slate to gaunt. mkoll says it was caober, derin and lyse who led them out safe.  a real fighting retreat, well ordered despite the vicious hand-to-hand. they got them far enough back for mkoll's platoon to cover them. he's recommending honours for the three of them. i spoke to derin myself. daur sighed. well enough, thank you, viktor. hark shrugged. gaunt left daur and hark talking and limped out through the quiet operations centre. at the door, he met sergeant meryn on his way in. the primary tanith billet was in a scholam on the thirtieth level of hive tower three. the double-bunked dorms had been cleaned out to accommodate the off-world troopers. the shutters were closed and the phospha lamps turned down, and smoke from lho-sticks filled the dim air. soric limped down the aisle between the bunks in dorm five, exchanging quiet greetings with those men that weren't asleep. many were just unconscious, sprawled out on their cots, still wearing their battledress and the dirt and dried blood of the night before. soric himself was tired, but he was edgy too and he couldn't sleep. his lost eye ached like a bastard. soric stopped and stomped over to corbec's cot. he'd been stretched back in his undershirt on his cot, but now he sat up and pulled out a hip flask. surely that's not the sacra? but i commend your palate. not many verghasts can tell the difference. corbec chuckled. soric nodded. on phantine, both he and corbec had been badly wounded. it had been the latest in a long series of injuries the colonel had suffered. he'd almost died on his medi-bed, but for soric. because that had been where it had started. injured, soric had suffered some kind of transformation. he couldn't say what exactly, and he'd kept it quiet. but it was like something inside him had woken up. something he knew he had to keep secret from his friends and comrades. there had been twitches of craft in his family line, though never enough of anything to cause trouble. he'd believed the trait had passed him by, until the wounding on phantine. there, he'd known � simply known � that corbec had been dying of a nosocomial infection. his warning had saved corbec's life and that had just been the start.  since then, the messages had been coming more and more frequently. gak, but he wanted them to stop. still, he knew what corbec meant. corbec wasn't a young man anymore � neither of them were � and one injury too many would spell the end of their careers. neither of them wanted that but still� corbec smiled at him. soric shuffled his squat bulk down the aisle. he saw larkin fast asleep on a lower bunk, his long-las wrapped in his arms like a favourite girl. soric stopped dead and slowly looked around. something� something nagged him. something he didn't even have to open his damn message shell to know. two bunk rows away, he saw lijah cuu. cuu was flat on his belly on a top bunk, appearing to all around him to be asleep. but soric could see cuu's feline eyes were open, open and staring at larkin. he shuddered. cuu was a piece of work. if he had it in for larks, soric pitied the poor bastard sniper. maybe he should tell someone about� he stopped himself. cuu was looking at him now, returning the stare. soric looked away and walked on. what would he tell anyone anyway? that he'd got a feeling? a bad feeling? a handwritten note from himself saying cuu was a mad feth who needed to be watched at all times? the youngest ghost had spread his tanith pipes out on his bedroll and was cleaning the chanters with a wire brush. milo moved the chanter pipes so that soric could sit down. the old verghastite pulled a scrap of blue paper from his pocket. instead of speaking, soric handed the scrap of paper to him. milo did. hand-written on the sheet was the line: ask milo. trust milo. he'll know. gaunt hated combat hospitals. they reminded him too much of the consequences of his profession. the civitas beati had assigned a public health clinic on the tenth floor of hive tower three as the tanith infirmary. it was a spartan hall of metal tiles and plastic screens. as he limped through the entranceway, he was assailed by the reek of antiseptic, which was so sharp and strong it almost but not quite masked the underlying aroma of blood and human waste. a hand bell was ringing. infardi volunteers and local medical staff moved between the beds in the dim light, and in one corner an ecclesiarchy provost was delivering the last rites. candles flickered under their glass hoods. someone was crying out with pain. through a partly-drawn screen, gaunt saw curth and lesp fighting with a thrashing body. blood was pooling on the floor under the gurney. he took off his cap and limped further into the chamber. looking left and right he finally located mkvenner, lying in a cot at the far western end under the windows. night was falling outside, and mkvenner's bed was bathed in bars of cold, blue light. gaunt saw kolea sitting by ven's side in silent vigil. though his mind was ruined, kolea seemed to know things, sense things. gaunt was glad that mkvenner wasn't alone at this time. he started to walk towards ven's bed when dorden appeared from a side room. doctor. i came to check on the wounded. dorden nodded. there was tension between them. dorden shook his head. stress. upset. not everything is about you. gaunt. zweil closed his eyes, as if in regret. dorden shrugged. gaunt checked his pocket watch. it was a quarter after seven and he wasn't even changed. he insisted. he turned back and squeezed zweil's hand. zweil nodded. gaunt limped out into the main infirmary hall and started down to mkvenner's bed. then he stopped. mkvenner and kolea were gone. the holy balneary was empty. there was no sound except the gentle slap of the water in the main pool. the dim air was wreathed with steam and the tangy smell of iron. by the light of the fluttering candles that lined the long, limestone staircase, kolea helped mkvenner plod his way down. biolumin globes shone on the steam below, their light picked out on the ripples of the sacred pool. mkvenner coughed violently, and his hand was wet with blood as he took it from his mouth. kolea held on to him tightly to stop him falling. don' you stop. hold me tight and i'll get you there. the wracks hit him so hard that he bent over and blood spattered on the gleaming limestone stairs. mkvenner sank to his knees. kolea shook his head. he reached into the pocket of his jacket and produced a truly awful plaster effigy of the saint, a pilgrim nick-nack. kolea put the effigy back into his coat. mkvenner started coughing again. more blood came up and mkvenner's wracks became so violent, he passed out. kolea bent over and picked the big tanith up. grunting with effort, his legs shaking, he continued on down the steps, carrying mkvenner in his arms. mkvenner didn't answer. his head hung limply. carrying the dying scout, kolea descended into the water, up to his shins, his knees, his thighs, his waist. the buoyancy of the water collected mkvenner's limp form up and floated him. kolea pushed out, the water up to his throat, keeping mkvenner on the surface. blood stained out in a wide fan around them. kolea cried out. he looked up suddenly. zweil leaned forward in the bathchair lesp was pushing and stared at the candlelit flight of white steps below them. they could smell the sulphurous water. lesp? help me. lesp grunted. zweil complained. sweat was beading on his forehead from the effort, and lesp was panting. moisture coated every smooth limestone stair, and every step they took was a disaster waiting to happen. dorden said suddenly from behind them. gaunt nearly fell. they were halfway down the white staircase. mkvenner got up on the steps and sat down, soaked through. he started to laugh. ven? mkvenner was laughing heartily, as if at some enormous cosmic joke. a man in his condition surely shouldn't be able to laugh so violently. unless� his gaze finally found gaunt's face. lord general lugo exuded power and authority in his white, high-collared dress uniform, but his tone didn't match his appearance at all. he sounded positively nervous. biagi and kaldenbach were nearby, and gaunt could see rawne, mkoll, daur and hark in amongst the gathering. no, sir.  it was also witnessed by my chief medic, an orderly named lesp, and by ayatani zweil. ayatani zweil made me conversant with the etiquette concerning such events. gaunt nodded. lugo stiffened and looked around, suddenly aware of the image he was projecting. he forced a smile. hark asked softly, as he reached gaunt's side. dorden doesn't know what happened. the scars were still there: old, pink, smooth, knotted across the back of the head from the base of the neck up to the crown. the hair had never properly grown back through the crumpled tissue, and kolea had kept his head shaved. ana curth paused and then lifted the hand mirror again. haven't you done enough? why don't you sit down? criid was down. hurt. enemy fire. those damn loxatl freaks. i remember the impacts of their flechette blasters. that distinctive sound� the hiss, the rattle of the shrapnel barbs. i went to get tona. she was with allo and jenk, and they were dead. she'd caught shrap in the arm and the side. it looked bad. i picked her up and started to run. oh, gol! no! don't misunderstand me! i'm only scared of the unknown. trench war. first female sergeant things have moved along a bit in two years. get it over with. dorden was packing up the instruments and glanced over at him. he was trying to disconnect the power lead from the base of the resonator paddle, but his mind was everywhere and he couldn't remember how the lead-lock worked. he had to put the device down quickly so mkvenner wouldn't notice his distraction. mkvenner shrugged. there's no trace of any internal bleeding. there's not even a residue of blood pooled in your abdomen. well, i fething don't! mkvenner shrugged again. we fight the archenemy because we believe in the holy truths. terrible things happen, unnatural things, warp-magic things, and we accept them because we believe. an ayatani declared. ayatani kilosh moved towards him through the gathering crowd. a bullet in the head. that's what i'll get. they don't even have to prove anything. if anyone thinks, or even thinks they think, that i'm touched by the warp, i'll be executed. it's his job. it's the duty of every one of us. if i found out one of my boys was touched, i'd do them myself. no question. i'm not an idiot. soric sat back. i was the kid, the lucky mascot, the last living civilian from tanith. varl had been playing on my rep to stage a few �entertainments' on the troop transport and some of the other regiments got nervous. i was reported. she got to the truth and uncovered it. she found out i was a fake and exposed me. soric breathed heavily and rubbed his dry hands together. i had been starting to believe myself. but she got the truth out. and i realised i'd been playing with fire. he reached into the thigh pocket of his fatigue pants and fished out a crumpled packet of lho-sticks. i don't know. all i know is, i'm not touched. never was. i'm not in any way special but i know how hard it can get if they suspect you. so tell gaunt. maybe that's why the message told you to speak to me. sound advice. i've had a warning. i don't know what it means, but it's gonna be bad. i have to tell someone� gaunt, who knows? but if i tell, that's the end for me. goodbye, agun, nice to have known you. i don't know, brinny. should i be looking after myself or looking to the greater good? milo walked away down the promenade. the brass shell had been wriggling like a rat. he unscrewed it and routinely tipped out the note. nine are coming. stop gakking around and be a man. milo can be trusted, but he's lying. he is special. don't tell him. don't scare him. the clock's reached midnight. hark stepped out of the shadows. hark nodded. hark raised a gloved hand and beckoned milo over to him with one crooked finger. milo stiffened as hark produced a scrumpled piece of blue paper from his storm-coat pocket and opened it out, holding it so that milo could see. it read: guheen's going to get himself pulped if he goes that way. the tank is behind the cabinet maker's shop. milo hurried away and hark turned and stared up at the massive window lights that ran along the promenade bay. up in the deep blue, stars were shining. some of the stars were ships. captain wysmark signed off. asked colonel zebbs, the ship's senior armsman, standing to attention behind kreff. ensign valdeemer took the data-slate from the waiting deck servitor, reviewed it quickly, and then began to stride purposefully across the steel deck of the omnia vincit towards the fleet captain's pulpit to his left, where the edge of the bridge deck dropped away, the dozens of helm servitors, techpriests and astropath navigators were arranged in descending tiers, like the upper circle of a great theatre. it took a massive crew to control a battleship the size of the omnia vincit, a massive bridge crew alone the bridge space was vast and vaulted like a gigantic basilica, its high domed roof painted with beautiful frescos of the actes sanctorum. valdeemer was just a small part of that crew, and a recent part too. he'd joined the ship just eighteen months before, but already he was a junior deck officer. he knew he had a bright future. one day, it would be him sitting up there in that magnificent throne, bio-linked to the ship's systems, commanding the power of a god in the emperor's name. to get there, he had to shine. to excel. to do his job in exemplary fashion and be seen to be doing it too. he could have voxed the report for the fleet captain's attention, but it was important, and suited personal delivery. besides, it brought him to the fleet captain's attention. he hurried up the alabaster steps of the pulpit pausing briefly at the top as the navy armsmen guards scanned him and then stood aside. fleet captain esquine terrified every member of the great ship's crew. even valdeemer, for all his confidence, was cowed by him. it was hard to tell where the fleet captain's gilded throne ended and his own body began. he was encased in golden armour, intricately wrought and etched, and his armour engaged directly with the throne so he formed a solid, engraved structure. his hands and arms were fused into the arms of the seat, and the back of his head, in its skullcap of gold, was locked against the throne's high back. esquine's hands were set palm-down on the arms of the throne, and only his gold-jacketed fingers moved, dancing like a pianist's. at their bidding, multi-jointed servo arms raised and lowered in front of the fleet captain's eyes, presenting pict-plates, larger actuality screens, and data-slates. the fleet captain held them up, sometimes four or more at a time, overlaying, comparing, transferring data from one to another with a blink, interlocking and compressing information into tight holographic spheres that floated around the throne. esquine's face was long-browed and noble. his blade of a nose had a slight hook to it, and his pale eyes were lashed with nearly invisible white hairs. the gold tracery of circuitry was woven into his ears, his cheekbones and the skin of his forehead from the edges of the skullcap, giving his flesh a jaundiced tinge. his mouth was invisible behind the grille of a vox-caster that rose from his gilded chest plate like a breathing mask. valdeemer smoothed the crisp front of his uniform jacket, shook out his braided cuffs, adjusted the sit of his emerald sash, and stood to attention. esquine asked. i can read, ensign. esquine's gaze returned to the slate, and a servo-arm moved in to offer up another for comparison. valdeemer blinked and looked down. he was standing on the outer decking of the command pulpit. the throne itself was set on a raised disc of polished plasteel in the centre. he quickly stepped up onto the edge of this inner platform. there was a slight vibration. the disc began to move, sliding backwards. the adamantine bulkhead wall behind the throne parted with a hiss of disengaging magnetic locks, and the entire throne platform � and valdeemer along with it � retracted through the opening space. as the shadow of the bulkhead passed over him, valdeemer felt the retracting throne-platform begin to rotate too. it turned them through one hundred and eighty degrees until esquine's throne was now facing into the secret, armoured chamber behind his pulpit. the strategium. the bulkhead shutters closed, sealing them in. valdeemer felt a rush of excitement. this was the first time he had been invited into the inner sanctum of command. the dim, heavily buttressed chamber was ovoid. tech-priests and senior deck officers stood or sat at console stations built into the walls between the buttress stanchions, and seven more perched at high podium consoles facing inwards around the actuality sphere that flickered and glowed in the centre of the room. there was a constant background murmur of vox chatter, cursor chimes and machine language. commander velosade was in charge here. the actuality sphere flickered, dissolved and reformed, slightly wider and sparer in detail. valdeemer recognised immediately they were looking at a 3d verisim of the entire inner system. there, the bright fuzz of the local star, there herodor, and the other four inner planets, the bright band of the asteroid belt. astropathicae report parameters verified. perturbation reads at warp modulus eleven two nine nine seven, nine au out. tracking cogents. concordance estimated at ninety-three minutes. awaiting confirmation. an officer of esquine's rank � and a ship like the omnia vincit � could normally expect to have a considerable attendant fleet in support. however, esquine's battleship, with only two frigates in attendance, had been sent to carry lord general lugo to herodor by the war-master as a mark of special respect, and the recently arrived tanith had brought only one frigate and one heavy cruiser as escort vessels. three frigates, a cruiser, a ship of the line, and fleet tender vessels � not too shabby as far as a flotilla detail went, but badly under strength in terms of fleet engagements. velosade nodded, and started growling orders. all the strategium crew began working, many of them suddenly speaking loudly and urgently into their vox-links. valdeemer felt a flush of pride run through him. its vast engines cycling up to one tenth power, the frigate berengaria moved away from herodor, prowling forward into the interplanetary gulf. though only classified as a light cruiser, it was massive by any standards of measure: a long, fortified, angular vessel, its barbed hull dull green. frigates of the berengaria's pattern were fast and well-armed, the blade-edge of any serious navy group. open the hatches. boarding parties to ready. transfer the wounded out. kreff snapped impatiently. he said, and the soldier was running to the bridge exit. kreff halted. he shouted. the hatch ground open. there was no one on the other side. no sirens, no alarms, no smell of fire or scenes of panic. zebbs stepped through. his armsmen hurried in after him, spreading out. the hallway was dark, and it smelled of stale air as if the scrubbers were malfunctioning. zebbs wasn't surprised. this was an old ship, poorly maintained. kreff yelled into the vox horn. he'd just heard a loud and suddenly cut-off roar over the channel that had wiped signals out. kreff shouted at his aides. a second later, from a different vox source, they tuned in the sounds of shouting. confused, demented shouting. and the smack of gunfire. kreff turned to see captain wysmark striding towards him across the bridge. wysmark, tall and saturnine in his green dress uniform, seemed unflustered. sodak would have been surprised if it had. according to the watch briefing, they were expecting something in the order of sixteen ships, and the actuality sphere showed only eight newcomer vessels. a fleet disposition emerging from warp space often came through in several waves. he was a cautious man. without that caution, he'd never have lived long enough to become a warship's commander. a crew-servitor, short and broad with circuitry glinting across its black metalwork, turned from its station and handed valdeemer a data-slate. the ensign immediately hurried it across to the fleet captain's throne. hard rounds whined down the companionway and rattled off the metal partitioning, causing the armsmen in sublieutenant epsin's team to duck for cover. something was wrong with the deck lights. only the frosty green auxilary lighting panels were illuminated and, from the smell of the air, the circulators were out or dying too. there was a buzzing noise too, very faint, that came and went. cabling fritzing out, epsin thought. another volley of shots. epsin saw the deformed slugs bounce onto the deck plating and roll. they looked like the crushed butts of lho-sticks. it was sweep-fire. epsin ordered. the armsmen party hurried ahead, hugging the metal walls of the companionway. almost immediately, more hostiles appeared around the junction turn ahead, rattling auto-fire in their direction. epsin's pointman let out a cry and slumped sideways against the wall. wysmark smiled slightly. kreff turned smartly and instructed the signals officer. he turned back to his captain's side. wysmark shook his head and returned his attention to the monitor. the odds were high there'd be infiltrators and heretics amongst them. we're obliged to help a ship in distress, even if it turns out to be a trap. if there are heretics aboard the troubadour, then they've been here in orbit for three days. there was a slight time-lag delay before wysmark's image nodded and smiled at the fleet captain's remark. epsin plunged through the thick smoke pluming down the air-gate's entry deck. the walls were marred with shot damage, and several bodies lay on the deck. rough, dirty men in drab red armour, their faces covered in black iron masks. more than simple heretics, epsin thought. he waved his men up. along the side hallway that led to the other gate entries, he heard sporadic gunfire. and the buzzing again, that damn buzzing. like an insect in a jar. epsin saw a figure in front of him, through the smoke. a tall figure� no, three figures. one tall man, cloaked in pilgrim green and hooded, clutching two smaller figures to his sides with thick, powerful arms that were laced with tattoos. the smaller figures were dressed in rags, shivering and dinging to the man in green like frightened children. they turned their faces towards him, and epsin gasped as he beheld their twisted, runtish, eyeless visages. in unison, they opened their mouths, and the buzzing grew much louder, as if the lid had come off the jar and freed the insect. epsin coughed and staggered, shaking his head frantically to get rid of the buzz. he knew what this was. he tried to adjust his headset to send a warning to the captain. the armsman beside him, a stalwart ship-trooper who had been in epsin's team for nine years, turned slowly.  his mouth was slack, and blood ran copiously from his nose and tear-ducts. flight leader to screen elements, form on me for a second pass. more traffic inbound. esquine fell silent. around him, above the machine-code chatter of the strategium, he could hear the ship's priesthood chanting their blessings to secure victory in combat. bright red lamps began to cycle and flash and a moaning alarm siren started to sound. esquine felt a shiver run through him as the neuro-plugs linking him to the ship's systems delivered the multiple responses of an imperial battleship rising to full combat mode. esquine's heart pounded as the reactors came to full power, his fingers twitched as the weapon batteries made ready to fire, his flesh tingled as the shields rose. he closed his eyes and experienced a rushing sense of expanded vision as power was diverted from non-essential systems to boost the main sensor cone. he looked, and saw the enemy bearing down. the void was incandescent with rippling fireballs and traceries of light. shumlen gunned in under the rake of the enemy's forward anti-ship batteries and headed under the belly of the main vessel. it was huge, easily the size of the omnia vincit, a chaos battleship, its black hull so covered with turret clusters and shield pods it looked diseased and blistered. three chaos cruisers ran with it, fearsomely lithe warships with serrated hulls. two were decked in red and gold, the third black with its ribbed superstructure painted white. the berengaria's fighter screen had met the ships head on, so as to minimise the angles of fire available to the enemy gunners, but even so shumlen had already lost about thirty ships to the massive anti-fighter barrage. every pilot knew the drill. once they were on the enemy, it was individual action. there was no hope of formation tactics in a fight zone this confused. shumlen hugged the enemy hull as close as he dared. he loosed one underwing missile, but was already well past by the time it detonated and he was unable to tell what surface damage he might have inflicted. a lightning tumbled past in front of him, causing him to veer as his collision warning system blared briefly. the lightning was coming apart, shredding as it fell like a comet towards the hulking surface of the battleship's hull. pulse lasers chased shumlen, stitching the darkness with phosphorescent bolts. he banked hard left, saw a raised missile turret ahead, and fired his second missile. the blast dazzled him and his whole ship shook violently as he flew out of the blastwash. a lightning slid close to him, almost in formation, and then exploded as pulse fire from the hull found it. another two shot over the top of him and began strafing runs along the underhull. shumlen lost sight of them in the vivid firestorm. his pulse was just beginning to lift. one of his wingmen repeated. the enemy had got its fighter screen launched. sodak looked over the data. two of the enemy cruisers were positively identified: the cicatrice, with its white-ribbed superstructure, and the revenant, its red hull laced with gold. the third cruiser was either the harm's way or the suture. snarled sodak. the deck rocked beneath him slightly. the master of ordnance glanced over at the captain from his position at the fire control station. sodak turned his attention to the actuality sphere. the revenant's course was vectoring it in after the slow moving munitorum ships that had come out of the warp. the revenant, swooping in like an interstellar predator, seemed to finetune its path as it passed the berengaria as if to taunt sodak. its main weapons blasting forward, the berengaria lit up its port side with fierce fire from its flank batteries. the revenant made a desultory return of fire from its own side armaments as it thundered past. signal the civilian fleet again, velosade. we will punish any further infringement of the edict in a similar fashion. i will not have non-military vessels confusing the issue with unauthorised movement. valdeemer frowned. he knew sodak's orders had been an unequivocal instruction to engage. he had fire on nine decks, a reactor crippled and shields close to failure. the air was ringing with overlapping klaxons. he could smell acrid smoke. smoke gathering in the circulator system, too thick and dense to be expunged by the air scrubbers. the massive enemy warship was right on them now, so close sodak could actually see it as a dot through the glasteel windows of the bridge. sodak didn't have time to even register the salvo on the augur scope. the berengaria pitched wildly. parts of the upper hull splintered away in a spray of micro-fragments. power failed for a few seconds on the bridge as an explosion tore across the forward helm position, incinerating three helm officers, five servitors and tactical officer persson. yarden was still at his post, blood gushing from a shrapnel wound in his chest. blood bubbled at his lips as he tried to call out a situation report, his dripping hands fumbling with the fire control console. sodak knew the situation, even though yarden couldn't report, even though the actuality sphere had failed and the augur-scopes were dead. battle engagement pattern. signal wysmark and tell him to stop wasting time. we need the navarre now. �message written in soric's hand gaunt had arrived half asleep at the hastily called meeting just before dawn. lugo and his house staff had occupied a mansion on the ninety-seventh level of old hive. it was a place of faded grandeur. the walls and high ceilings were cased in shiny black ebonite inlaid with matt detailing in arthrocite, and the floor was paved with pink, earth-fired tiles throughout.  on every fourth wall panel in the entry hall, an electrolamp was set in a brass wall sconce, and long webs of glinting steel-lace hung as drapes at each arched doorway. it wasn't made clear to gaunt whose palace-home this was, or where they had gone to make way for lugo. to be honest, he wasn't thinking much of that. he was bleary headed as the postern sentries let him in and showed him the way down two long hallways and up a flight of brick steps to the room where lugo was waiting. gaunt had been expecting some kind of formal staff summit, and was surprised to find lugo alone except for kaldenbach. the room was cold � the whole mansion was cold � as if the ancient heating pipes and hypercausts of the crumbling old hive were weak and inefficient at this high level. lugo sat in a suspensor chair, dressed in a thick houserobe over his uniform shirt and breeches. his jacket and cap lay on a tall wooden dressing stand beside him. he was sipping caffeine from a porcelain cup. a portable thermal heater was standing on the floor, warming his booted feet. the room had tall, lancet windows of touched, coloured glass in two walls, and a set of ornate glass doors in the third that appeared, through the veil of a steel-lace drape, to give access out onto some kind of balcony or roof terrace. kaldenbach stood beside these doors, arms folded, looking either stubborn or threatening. gaunt wasn't quite sure what the man was shooting for. kaldenbach, who had started to move at lugo's offer, continued anyway even when it was refused, and helped himself to a cup from a silver vacuumjug that stood on a dresser against the wall. lugo cleared his throat delicately and took another sip. lugo shrugged as if this was trifling. lugo nodded, and gestured for gaunt to continue. that must have rankled, having me arrive and get in the way. but nothing you couldn't handle. last night, lord general. when your little pawn did something you weren't expecting. when sanian � and don't ask me to explain this, for it defies rational explanation � when sanian became the real thing after all. she is the beati, she is truly everything she believed herself to be, everything you pretended she was. a miraculous being in the strictest sense of the term. and that changed things. you have no idea what to do. you can't manipulate her any more. she is suddenly beyond your powers of reason and control, beyond your basic understanding. you're afraid. you're out of your depth. and your plan is coming apart at the seams. thank you for being so open. i have known the saint to be genuine from the very start, and have supported her in that light. nothing has changed. she has always been a miraculous figure to me. lugo put on his cap, looked gaunt in the eyes, and then stretched out his hand. gaunt, surprised, shook it. � i'm pretty sure it is more significant than we realise. space and time and� fate, if you will� are all coming together, and synchronising. even before sanian truly manifested as the beati last night, the ripples of that happening were spreading through this sector and beyond. signs, portents, auguries. you've heard them all, and put them down to hysteria amongst the faithful, i'm sure. but they are more than that.  every psyker in the sector � ours and theirs � must have felt as much. victory in the sabbat worlds, the archenemy put to fire and flight. gaunt turned. sabbat stood in the doorway of the chamber, one hand raised to hold back the steel-lace drapes. she was wearing simple, grey combat fatigues and heavy black troop boots. lugo and kaldenbach did likewise. through its patterned folds, gaunt could see the household troopers hovering outside, too scared to come in after her. sabbat placed a hand gently on his arm and he fell silent, unable to speak. you and the tanith. gaunt asked. she took him by the hand and led him over to the glass doors, which she opened with a press of her fingers. they went through, out onto the roof terrace. lugo and kaldenbach followed. the terrace was a semi-circle of rockcrete jutting like a shelf from the steep roof levels of the old hive spire. a glasteel dome shielded them from the arctic atmosphere. the great sprawl of the civitas beati spread out below them, far below, a brown maze of angular shadows. the massive shape of the second hive tower rose up nearby, almost to their level, a slabby silhouette against the just rising sun. around the edge of the terrace were terracotta planters. the roses and sambluscus planted in them had withered and died into gnarled twigs, untended, but they reminded gaunt of lord chass' roof garden in the upper spine of vervunhive. gaunt felt a twinge of fear and melancholy. but for a metal flower from that garden, he would have died on verghast. there were no flowers here. sabbat pointed up at the sky. it was thin blue, creased by bars of lustrous yellow and furrows of cloud in the east. the last stars were still visible. lugo held his gaze for several seconds. gaunt could almost see his mind working through possibilities, necessities and maybes. now that was interesting. shumlen's vitals-reader had just shown his pulse rate spike the highest it had been in seventeen years. one for the logbook, he thought. he'd just pulled a turn so tight the g-force had all but crushed him and blinded him for about fifteen seconds. he blinked hard to get his squeezed eyeballs to refocus. where the hell was that bat? he hit the thrusters and spun his bird down into a wide evade. blitz fire and enemy cannonades fluttered brightly in the darkness outside his canopy. he saw a lightning far to his left, two bats on its back. twenty-seven? was that liebholtz? las-fire chattered and pinked, studding the blackness, brilliant, then gone. the lightning dogged, banked and came around, but the bats were still on him. a bat he hadn't even seen, wings hooked, chin-cannon flashing, went by and over him, away. damage alerts beeped from his instrumentation and he cancelled them out. his heads-up display swam and shifted, crosshairs drifting as he turned again. liebholtz's voice squealed over the link. his thumb trembled over the fire-stud in the top of his stick. he was head on. he kicked the burners to full, crossing the lightning coming the other way. the nearest bat, right on its tail, slammed into his display and the finders locked it up. the crosshairs went bright and hard and started to flash. the lock-tone sounded, a rising shrill. he depressed his thumb and fell into a roll. he felt the shudder of his cannon pumping, the rhythmic grind of the autoloaders. the bat flamed out in a bright fireball. winnowing pieces of debris clattered off his hull and canopy. liebholtz wasn't clear yet. he was trying to climb out of the horizontal vector. typical air-boy, shumlen thought.  liebholtz was a great pilot, truly gifted, but he'd come out of planetary airforce, like so many pilots. he still thought in terms of up and down, right and left. no such things. any true void-fighter knew that. and shumlen was a true void-fighter. oh yeah, this close to a planet or super-massive ships there was a marginal grav-element to allow for, but that was just part of the game. to void-fight, you had to think in three dimensions at once. shumlen flipped his bird up and over. liebholtz was trying to cut up, but the bat was sticking with him. shumlen's heads-up hunted, washing left and right. he saw the bat. a locust-pattern interceptor, painted in tiger stripes. long nosed, twin-boomed, spiky. its chin-gun was already spelling out liebholtz's doom. liebholtz's inarticulate last words spluttered out of the vox. his bird was consumed in a bright yellow flare. shumlen had the bat. the killer. it jinked back and forth, but he kept it in field. god-emperor, but this jockey was good. shumlen tried a shot and missed. he snatched his thumb off to conserve ammo. thirty-seven per cent munitions left. one missile. twenty-two per cent fuel remaining. the locust rolled back and over, coming down facing the other way and spiralling. neat� but not neat enough. shumlen powered past him, and began to dive down towards the vast hull landscape of the archenemy battleship as it slid by, taunting the gun batteries. they didn't let him down. neither did the bat. the batteries started pounding the moment shumlen went over them, but he was too fast for them to make a kill. they were still pounding when the bat chased after him, hungry for shumlen's bird. the bat went up in a messy spray of burning gases and hull debris. shumlen switched back up, got a lock almost immediately, and killed another bat on the turn with a drumming salvo from his cannon. a cannon shell from somewhere punched through his port wing and he turned hard again, right into the backwash of an af blitz. shumlen slunk away, circling in a deep, open turn. the bat zipped past him and he locked it tight. his cannon shuddered. it blew out like a flower, the fuselage peeling away into silver shreds. he saw the pilot vaporise as he tried to eject. a dismal toll rang from his instruments. he looked at his ammo counter and saw the worst. count zero. and the fuel load wasn't much better. he flipped back. one missile left. time to make it count. sweeping in and out of the bursting patterns of af, he powered towards the bow of the archenemy battleship. the forward launch decks, open like mouths in the front snout of the beast. a missile there � bats passed in front of him, chasing lightnings. more af, incandescent. then a bat with a bird on its tail, spraying rounds. kreff yelled. captain wysmark didn't seem to hear him. that buzzing. kreff could hear it. what the hell was it? sir! kreff stammered, getting up. he was astonished at the captain's brutality. crewmen had just died, unnecessarily. wysmark ignored him, but the navarre was coming around nevertheless. kreff joined his captain at the master console, reading the display. enginarium to full motive, shields up, weapons to power� and a red light kreff didn't recognise. kreff flinched back as he realised it was a drop of blood on the console, underlit by an enginarium rune. another drip fell next to it. blood was running out of the captain's left tear duct. the knuckles crushed his nose and made him bite through his lip. help me! kreff gasped. kreff yelled into the vox. the side batteries of the omnia vindt lit up and stayed lit. the navarre's shields soaked up the merciless bombardment for several seconds, swirling and coruscating like molten glass. then they began to buckle and fail. the navarre heeled over, its hull shredding and burning. its gravitic assemblies shut down and it started to fall, stern-first, into the gravity well of the planet. a vast internal explosion disintegrated it before it hit the atmosphere. on the navarre's bridge, executive officer kreff was still trying to raise the omnia vindt on the fleet channel as he died. the debris from the navarre rained down towards the surface of herodor, becoming meteors in the upper atmosphere. one of those meteors was a standard pattern escape pod. it rocked and tumbled violently, rattling and vibrating as it plunged. the two runt psykers were wailing in terror, flinching at every lurch. mkvenner asked lightly. gol kolea straightened the front of his fatigue jacket and nodded. side by side, they walked in through the entrance of the tanith billet. the dawn call had sounded some minutes before, and the troops were rousing. water pots were clattering onto stove rings, and men were dressing. it was exactly the same as every morning in the guard, simple routine. only the place � a scholam by the look of it, kolea thought � was different. kolea nodded. no one gave him a second look. news hadn't reached here yet. he wandered down the rows of bunks, looking around, hungry for the sight of familiar faces. there was a little ache in the back of his heart that some faces wouldn't be there. muril� piet gutes � try kolea stopped, and sat down on an unmade bunk. his pack was there. he looked up at mkvenner. kolea sat for a moment as the bustle went on around him. then he took off his jacket and undervest and opened his pack to find a fresh shirt. the weight of the plaster effigy in his jacket pocket made him remember it was there he took it out, looked at it for a moment, and stuffed it down inside his pack for safety. kolea looked up. cuu had been walking by, dressed in his undershorts, fresh from the shower block. he had a towel over his shoulder. the painfully white, unhealthy skin of his scrawny, corded torso was covered in crude tattoos. you- � yeah, me. i'm back. lubba said, getting up off his bunk. kolea said lightly, sitting back down. hello, sir. gaunt told me about what went on, but i was keeping it to myself until� until� feth! the rest of his sentence was lost beneath the crushing pressure of corbec's bearhug. zweil made a chuckling sound and nodded. the doctor pushed zweil's chair down the aisles between the rows of vacated bunks towards the mobbing, clamouring concentration of troopers in the centre of the billet chamber. kolea was at the heart of it, laughing and chatting, answering the barrage of excited questions as best he could. everyone was there, morning drill forgotten. somebody had ordered in boxes of hot loaves from a nearby bakery, and sutlers had arrived with wheeled barrows laden with heated caffeine urns. no, not everyone, dorden noted. away through the rows of bunks, he saw lijah cuu, getting dressed. asked soric. blurted bonin. the crowd broke up in guffaws again. chiria asked quietly. kolea looked down at her scarred face. she'd never been pretty, but he knew the scars on her face were the worst thing that had ever happened to her. he sighed. chiria smiled. nessa put her arm around her. kolea shook his head. criid nodded. the mob parted politely to admit the doctor and the old man he was pushing in the chair. zweil sat at a strange angle, half his face curiously limp. he looked round at the troopers. called feygor through his throaty, monotone vox-box. she got up and fell over, pulling the open pack down off the bunk. kolea's stuff fell out onto the floor. she started to scrabble around, collecting them up and pushing them back into the bag. time for work. the archenemy is orbital and inbound, and we're expecting mass ground assault in the next hour. get dressed, get kitted, get ready and get moving. if you're of a faithful disposition, ask the god- emperor for his blessing. if you're a layman, put your head between your legs and kiss your fething ass goodbye. this is it. the crowd of ghosts broke up immediately, troopers running to their bunks, struggling into clothes, prepping weapons. on they came. the incarnadine, the cicatrice, the harm's way. running side by side like hunting dogs, angling in at twenty degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. and the revenant? where was that? flanking in from sunward, obliterating pilgrim ships. it had already incinerated all the transports in the relief convoy. esquine tensed. this was still manageable. this was still a tactical possibility. he had three ships. the omnia vincit was a vastly powerful flagship. the laudate divinitus was also capable. the frigate glory of cadia ought to be up to the mark. their commanders appeared before him on the deck of the strategium, redshot holoforms. captain cask of the glory. captain massinga of the laudate. both holoforms nodded. velosade relayed across the strategium. valdeemer leaned back against a bulkhead. his heart was thumping. the gigantic capital ship omnia vincit, flanked by its much smaller sister the frigate glory of cadia, powered away from the chilly light of herodor towards the trio of archenemy warships. beside them for a while, the heavy cruiser laudate divinitus turned away to port, and lit up its thrusters as it burned down towards the revenant. the revenant was picking off pilgrim ships, exploding them like paper targets on a circus showman's stall. some started to run. that just gave the revenant moving solutions. its guns raked through the translucent skein of the upper atmosphere. ships exploded and burned. a flurry of torpedoes from the closing heavy cruiser unsettled the revenant's shields, and it swung up to meet the imperial warship. the heavy cruiser was a third again as big as the gold-laced enemy ship. its fighter screen puffed out from it like a cloud of dust, and was met immediately by the rival's own screen. as the massive vessels closed, spitting beams of light and sprays of plasma, the tiny fighters billowed around each other, cloud into cloud, dust particles whirling away to infinity. the laudate divinitus fired a full volley of lances and torpedoes. the revenant gunned away, shields flaring flat white. it fired its own cannonade broadside as it fled across the laudate's bows. the imperial heavy cruiser shook. one of its shields ruptured. it fired back. the revenant brought its hind part in tight, turning in a forty-five degree angle on its prow. it came up facing the laudate, facing the railed shield. it fired its main lances. the laudate divinitus didn't explode. it came apart in a series of coughing, jerking seizures. the final shudder kicked off the enginarium, and sent out a shockwave that destroyed nine pilgrim ships at anchor. the revenant dipped low into the thin reaches of the upper atmosphere, and began to disgorge drop-pods and landing craft. hundreds of them. the glory of cadia hit the cicatrice so hard and with such sustain it began to burn. esquine was savouring the victory when he saw the enemy ship turn. the cicatrice, immolating, spent the last of its reactor power pushing itself forward. it rammed the glory amidships and the two vessels locked together, burning like a small star in close orbit space.  the harm's way and the massive incarnadine were pummeling the omnia vincit with their batteries. esquine felt the pain from the shields. shumlen hit thrust and came in at the open and lit port of the incamadine's starboard launch deck. he felt himself pressed back in the grav seat as the thrusters kicked in. his heads-up locked in at the hangar bay mouth. one missile left. something flew out at him. a bat, yes. but really like a bat. a dark, hooked shape. small, fast, not a locust-pattern ship, he was certain. something xenos. very xenos. he banked, hunting. the bat zipped around and was behind him. shumlen tried to turn, tried to get an angle so he could loose his last missile. the bat wouldn't let him be. shumlen turned hard again, and again. he couldn't lose it. he turned for one last time and the stall siren howled. fuel out. he was drifting. the bat zipped past him and then turned back, sliding up and coasting up alongside him. shumlen looked at it. his pattern recognition systems bleeped out confirmation. a raven. a dark eldar raven attack ship. it hovered beside him for a second, and then flitted away. there was no power left in his lightning. shumlen looked round, dead in space. the vast superstructure of the incarnadine ploughed towards him. and met him like a cliff face. his tiny craft burst and flared for a second as it was run down against the massive prow of the battleship. the incarnadine didn't even feel it. the raven, circling nearby, dipped its barbed wings once to acknowledge the fall of a fine pilot, and then turned and burned towards the pallid glow of herodor. the control console of the sleek raven reflected yellow light up across the features of skarwael. he was grinning, a rictus of bared fangs and tight white flesh. the bloody game was on. every alarm and klaxon in the civitas beati was blaring. even the great prayer horns at the city quarter-points were wailing terrible rising notes. storm shields began to close on all the windows, decks and apertures in the hive towers, and through the inner precinct of the civitas. segmented plating slid up to protect the glass domes of the agriponic farms. there was uproar on the streets. citizens fled en masse to the sub-level bunkers, to the storm cellars, to the lower levels of the hive towers. technically, there were appointed shelters for all, but the protocols were old and hadn't been used for generations. citizens ignored them, or had never known them, and fled hysterically to the nearest shelter. the highways and principals of the mid-city and skirt districts were choked with road traffic. a lot of it had already been mobile at dawn, and it was swelled by private vehicles heading across town towards imagined places of safety. the traffic jammed up the routes, solid and nose-to-tail in places, and transports were quickly abandoned. in some outer streets, the roads were deserted but for rows of immobile vehicles, some with the engines still running, most with doors and hatches open. the main barracks of the regiment civitas beati was an imposing keep that overlooked principal i in the high town area, between the gigantic stacks of hive towers one and two. in the main yard inside the walls, the regiment was assembling and breaking up into troop elements. columns of apcs and light armour units were grumbling up the ramps from the garages under the keep, directed by marshals to embarkation points where in theory they would pick up their assigned squads. there was no time for briefing. instructions would be delivered en route via tac logis. all anyone knew was that they were following gar3 � ground assault response 3 � one of biagi's preformed emergency strategies. timon biagi himself stood in the open top of an armoured command vehicle, listening to the tac logis flow in his earpiece, watching the disposition. troopers, some still buckling up armour, poured out of the keep and into the yard, filing past the armourers' platforms to collect munitions and combat supplies. biagi was the two hundred and fifth marshal of the civitas. from this hour forward it would be his name, and his name alone, that historians would think of when considering the regiment civitas. for he would be the marshal that stood alongside sabbat at her returning. would they think of him like they thought of kiodrus, he wondered? a second kiodrus. he liked the feel of that idea. biagi looked up at the sky. it was unseasonably clear, and the violet dawn was turning into a cool white haze in a corner of the sky, the future was making itself visible. flashes and strobes of light, a thicket of twinkling stripes just visible in the growing glare, identified the monumental war now underway in orbital space. a war between gods, biagi thought. from down here where he stood, it looked like firecrackers. the ghost and life company elements moved out of the hive towers in rows of troop trucks and transporters, heading out into the skirt fan of the city. life company tanks and tracked armour led the way, smashing rows of stationary, abandoned vehicles out of their path where they blocked thoroughfares and junctions. gaunt rode in a salamander with corbec and hark. hydra gun platforms travelled alongside them for a few streets, and then turned off to left and right to occupy good firing positions in open squares and plazas in the hilly inner reaches of the civitas. hark asked. gaunt shook his head. he smiled. the plan was to assemble the main troop strengths in the city's geographical centre, towards the bottom of the guild slope, and wait. even combined, the tanith, life company, regiment civitas and herodian pdf had nothing like enough numbers to cordon the entire perimeter of the sprawling city. first officiary leger had even seconded the city arbites and the local civic militia forces to bolster the military presence, and still that left them lacking in numerical resources. the imperial forces would loiter in the city centre, from which point any part of the city extent was as near as any other, and wait to see what direction the ground assault came from. then they would respond fast, using transports, and channel their efforts in that particular area. it was impossible to tell where the first wave of assault would come from. gaunt had been through too many assaults from orbit � as assaulter and assaulted both � to think otherwise. there were so many variables. from the data, gaunt had seen, there were at least four archenemy warships up above them. unopposed, their combined firepower could raze the civitas down to the bedrock: streets, habs, hive-towers, even the armoured shelters underground. if the enemy decided not to bother with the complexity and effort of a ground assault and simply went for the kill, this war would be over before it started. gaunt looked round as corbec called out. the big tanith was pointing up at the northern sky. high up, streaks of orange fire were slashing across the pale sky. a few dozen at first, and then more.  hundreds more like a shower of meteorites, they rained down from high orbit overhead, diving north, leaving long, perfectly straight, perfectly parallel trails of flame and vapour in the sky behind them. they weren't meteorites. gaunt saw distant flashes light up the northern horizon as the first hit. a second later, a distant sound like continuous thunder rolled in from the great western obsidae. drop-pods. for a half-second, gaunt felt relieved. the archenemy was going for ground assault after all. then he reconsidered. death was not going to be swift and total. it was going to be slow and painful and hard. valdeemer sat up and looked around. he got up. the deck shook hard, and he steadied himself against a console. the crew servitor at the console was still working furiously, augmetic hands rippling over the display. the mechanical was totally oblivious to the chaos around them. valdeemer shook his head, trying to lose the swollen muzziness. blood spattered on the deck. he raised his hand and felt a deep gash across his forehead. they'd been hit. he'd been at esquine's side when the torpedo had struck them under the bridge tower. he remembered the numbing concussion, bodies flying. yes, that's right. he'd been thrown to the deck. valdeemer turned and hurried through the smoke towards the main station. the deck was littered with smouldering debris and fallen panelling. he had to step over several bodies. crewmen, deck aides, servitors, ripped apart by blast force or killed by flying debris. one of them was velosade. a piece of deck plating the size of a dinner plate had almost, but not quite, decapitated him. swallowing hard, valdeemer got to the station and reviewed the board. three shield failures. two hull breaches. fires on decks seven through eighteen and also in carrier bay four. lances were out. valdeemer tried to assemble a plan in his mind. his ringers flew across the console, activating and deactivating runes as they lit up, calling up displays � enginarium, structural, shielding, deck-to-deck � and then cancelling them. he routed power away from the huge firestorm on deck eight. he bypassed two cogitator nodes damaged on deck eleven and brought lance number three back on line. he sealed the deck hatches that had not closed automatically and shut off the oxygen supply fuelling the lower deck fires. he shut down reactor two, which was red-lining and clearly damaged, and kicked in auxiliary power from the redundant reactor in the omnia vincit's belly. why hadn't esquine already done these things? they were obvious, standard. valdeemer's bloody hands shook as they entered the code. esquine asked. valdeemer looked round at the fleet captain. the torpedo strike had vaporised the fleet captain's mind-impulse link, severing his connection to the massive ship. he was blind and deaf and lacking in all telepresent or hardwired connection to the omnia vincit, except for the waves of pain that washed through the ship into him as it took damage. kill them all� and if you can't do that, make the price of our lives a dear one. three locusts managed to enter the deck mouth. one was destroyed by af turret emplacements inside the deckway. the second was also hit by af fire, but managed to fire all six of its missiles into the belly of the carrier hold before it went up. the third, accelerating to hypersonic, made it in down the main launch deck, strafing as it went, and banked right into the munitions loading bay. there, just before it catastrophically ran out of flying space, it dumped its payload into the sub-deck autoloader shafts that lifted munitions up to the earner deck from the armoured heart of the omnia vincit. the chain reaction blew the side off the noble imperial ship in a vast flurry of underdeck explosions and fragmenting hull plates. gored, its guts exposed, the omnia vincit yawed. in the strateghim, valdeemer desperately converted three per cent of shield power back to the engines and pushed the battleship out from between the vicing archenemy ships. the omnia vincit slid forward out of the incarnadine's fire-field.  a three per cent drop on shield power wasn't much, but the harm's way, waiting at the bow like a jackal on a kill, didn't hesitate. it cycled up full load power from its main reactors and fired its lances at the overlay weakness. valdeemer turned from his post to look at esquine. the fleet captain was shaking with rage and sorrow, impotent and agonised. �attr. his voice, seldom heard so forcefully, echoed over the vox link and everyone, even gaunt and rawne, obeyed. casting a brief, blurred shadow and visible only for a second, something hook-winged swept low across the hab-block streets. a moment later, blasts tore through the buildings to their left. the locust had come in against the wind, its jet-whine inaudible until the last minute. ash and brick dust from the blasts were drifting across them.  the one-man assault craft, black bodies glinting in the sun, were travelling at rooftop height. they banked up and away into the sunlight, rolling. in their wake, fireballs rippled and flared along the surface. the ghosts could hear the popping, banging reports. there were other sounds too. the constant thump and slam of artillery and armour guns from all along the city's northern skirt. occasionally, when the wind was in the right direction, they could hear the fierce crackle of smallarms exchanges. lugo and his staff strategae had taken over the civitas tac logis, and were overseeing, literally, the imperial efforts from the high levels of the hive towers. from there, they were able to despatch remarkably accurate and current assessments of the archenemy invasion. all of it was bad news. four strike columns had assembled in the great western and northern obsidaes within fifty minutes of set down, mobilising fast and spearing into the northern city limits. one was driving into the glassworks from the northwest, two directly south into ironhall, and the fourth from the north-east into the masonae district. most of this seemed to be light assault armour from landers and storm-troop brigades from the first wave of drop-pods. in total, close to three hundred vehicle elements and eight thousand men, well supported by air cover and the artillery sections setting up in the obsidaes. that, under any circumstances, would have been bad enough. imperial numbers in the civitas beati hovered just under the seventeen thousand mark, provided militia and arbites units were figured in. but the imperials had only something in the order of one hundred and eighty armoured machines, of which seventy were unarmed carriers. no air cover. no artillery apart from some light regiment civitas field pieces. this lop-sided equation became a joke when the rest of the picture was factored in. out in the drop zone, behind the initial, fast mobilising enemy spearhead, a vast force was assembling. it was taking its time, ferrying armour and squads down in wave after wave of drop-ships and heavy lander-transports. it would let the spearhead forces take the brunt and crack the city open. then it would move in to consolidate. out on the obsidaes, tac logis calculated, over half a million men and a hundred thousand fighting machines waited to mount the second wave. and the count was rising with every incoming wave. well commanded, and with a feth-load of luck on their side, gaunt estimated, the imperial resistance would last five, maybe six days before annihilation. with lugo in the chair, they probably had about two. it was death either way. the only variable was time. supported by sections of the regiment civitas beati, the ghosts advanced through the masonae district, over which gaunt had defence command. kaldenbach was leading the ironhall resistance, and a herodian pdf colonel called vibreson headed the glassworks line. biagi, and a life company officer, major landfreed, held most of the remaining four thousand troop strengths in the middle city, ready for short-notice deployment. five hundred men of the regiment civitas garrisoned the hive quarter, mainly. gaunt believed, to buy enough time in the final, inevitable phase of the invasion for lugo to flee via shuttle from the crest level platforms. flee to where, only the god-emperor knew. the ghosts and their allies moved up through the narrow streets east of beati plaza. this district was largely untouched by war, apart from the strafing damage of the enemy air cover. the thoroughfares were ominously empty. the citizenry had fled. homes and commercial properties stood empty and lifeless, and discarded possessions littered the roads. as they prowled forward, bounding cover by squad from block corner to block corner, gaunt considered they had, despite everything, a kind of luck on their side. unopposed as they now were, the archenemy warships far above them could have ended the war quickly with aerial bombardment. instead, the enemy had opted for the gross effort and huge cost of a ground assault. he knew what that meant. they wanted the beati. poorly protected and underdefended as it was, the civitas beati was still large, and taking it a street at a time would be a bloody, painfully expensive task for any army. the archenemy was only undertaking it because of the prize. indeed, the archenemy had only come to herodor, only bothered with the place at all, because of that prize. the enemy commander wanted the saint. a body, at least� but a prisoner, that would be the greatest trophy. so an annihilating orbital bombardment was out of the question. no tangible proof of the beati's presence would be left. this was all about sabbat. everything they did, everything the enemy did. it was all about sabbat. tac logis crackled in gaunt's ear. kaldenbach's forces had engaged. initially unopposed, the invaders rolled into the northern edges of the masonae district. to the west of them, smoke and low-level flashes above the roofs showed where their associated columns were lancing through the ironhall. phalanxes of blood pact led the way, backed by files of stalk-armour, steg 4 lights and at70 reaver-pattern tanks. their way was unhindered. two at70s peeled off to destroy the prayer horn gorgonaught in a hail of close range fire, and a trio of stalk-tanks assisted blood pact sappers in blowing and cutting the ancient arches of the simeon aqueduct. water, the city's precious life-blood, poured from the shattered aqueduct and flooded several low-lying street blocks. locust dive bombing had already ruined the north end agridome. burning crop produce was billowing yellow-grey smoke into the sky through the ruptured dome seals. without seeing a trace of the vaunted imperial forces, the archenemy crossed brigat street into actes hill, and began to spread out into the masonae. the troopers, moving ahead of the armour, were singing. the song made mkoll's stomach heave. he warned. mkoll squeezed the tube's trigger spoon and an at rocket roared down the street, neatly killing the third steg 4 in the approaching file. the at70 behind it started to rev, and spattered fire from its coaxial cannon, but it was pretty much blinded by the black smoke ripping out of the dead steg. the two stegs in front of the kill spurred forward on their heavy, solid wheels, their compact turrets traversing as they hunted for the source of the ambush. the blood pact stopped singing and raced for cover positions. they didn't get very far. surch and loell were set up on the west side of the street, melyr and caill on the east. the two .50 cannons had a tight, interlocking field of fire, and preyed on the scattering ground troops mercilessly. red-armoured bodies tumbled, sprawled, flew backwards, flew apart. the two stegs up front wheeled round, now firing, raking the lines of the street and blowing out windows and plaster facades. in another few seconds they would lock on to one of the .50 positions. but they didn't have anything like a few seconds. he hit the remaining steg's munitions locker.  the shockwave brought the front of a nearby house down. the at70 lurched forward, grinding up and over the blazing wreckage of the first kill. as it came over, it fired its main gun. the roar was loud and impressive, but the shot was premature and whined away into the empty end of the street. caffran put his second rocket through the big, red tank's port tracks and crippled it. it slewed around, broken wheel bearings shrieking raw on the rockcrete. ghosts slipped from cover and leapt up onto its superstructure: bonin, domor and dremmond. bonin nailed the top hatch with a tube-charge, and left the rest to dremmond. gleefully reunited with his flamer, dremmond pushed the hose muzzle down into the smoking hatch-hole and gutted the tank with combusting promethium. bonin dropped down, grabbing the dead 70's pintle mount � a twinlinked bolter � and swung back to face down the street. he started to fire at the blood pact infantry squads pressing up to meet the ambush. mkoll called over the link. bonin, domor and dremmond quit the top of the tank and disappeared into the alleys off the street. at the same moment, the .50 teams dismantled their support weapons and hastened out of their positions. pushing forward rather more tentatively now, the blood pact advance reached the dead at70. there was no sign of enemy resistance. but there was a pack of three tube-charges strapped to the at70's shell magazine, courtesy of shoggy domor. three streets away, the lead stalk-tank was hit simultaneously by two tread fether rounds. wrapped in a brilliant fireball, it spun around, some of its legs thrashing out slackly like a carousel's arms. one leg severed entirely, and flew off, crashing through the front of a habitat unit. unfazed, the two stalk-tanks behind it scuttled forward over the burning debris, weapons pods tracking and firing, and each one was greeted by a rocket that blew its main hull to pieces. one collapsed, the other remained on its feet, limb segments dead and locked out, central body ablaze. he was up on the low roof of a hab building, behind the parapet. varl's platoon was dashing forward, along the line of the wall beneath him, in single file, firing into the bewildered blood pact troopers who suddenly found themselves without armour support. brostin's flamer gushed. guheen pulled the trip wire and the tube-charges fourteen platoon had laid across the roadway ignited in geysers of fire and rockcrete. the at70 almost flipped, its tracks blown away. it came down hard on its nose, the long snout of its main gun biting into the roadway before it came up. it made the mistake of trying to fire. either its barrel was deformed by the impact or dogged. whichever, the hi-ex shell choked, and blew back so hard the rear portion of the turret vented out like a burst paper bag. blood pact infantry flooded up around the burning beast and began firing. one, an officer, had a missile tube on his shoulder, and he dropped to one knee, aiming it at the store front where meryn and guheen were down in cover. he never got to fire it. at least, not alive. a hot-shot round from nessa bourah, up on a nearby roof, tore out his throat. he fell sideways and his dead hand spasmed on the spoon. the rocket winnowed away across the ground, spewing sparks and white flames. one blood pact trooper actually managed to leap up over it. he then died, along with the other dozen around him, when the rocket met the kerb and detonated. the archenemy forces penetrating the masonae suddenly realised they were in for a fight after all. they pushed on, resolved now. in latinate road, a slender, picturesque street of tailors' shops and leatherworkers' habs, daur, raglon and ewler brought their platoons in tight to meet the blood pact storm-thrust. a ferocious small-arms battle began. nearby, arcuda's platoon � twenty-three � met a flanking push from another five blood pact fire-teams. criid pulled her platoon back from meryn's position and joined with curral's, nailer's and rask's at the junction of toborio street and mason yard, where a vicious, mid-range infantry duel was developing. grell and theiss scurried their platoons in across the lanxlyn road and principal iii, smoking two stegs and a stalk-tank before meeting the infantry rush head on. in skye alley, soric's platoon was pinned down by a pair of stalk-tanks that wouldn't go away. soric coughed. kazel? go for the window. it was a hasty, automatic response to soric's command. the back-blast, contained in the room, almost killed him. the rocket spat out of the window, deflected sideways off a lamp-bracket and dropped down, entering one of the stalk-tanks through the roof hatch. biagi had drawn up gar 3 � ground assault response 3 � and it was on the money. rather than wasting time attempting to hold badly provisioned outer streets, biagi's plan had identified and described the various junctions and streetmeets where ambush and defence would work most effectively. it was pragmatic in that it gave ground to an invading enemy until good advantage could be had in defence, but it was thorough. biagi had analysed every street � not by slate-chart but by eye, by methodical observation � and worked out the strengths and weaknesses. he had read the city well. the ghosts' initial successes were as much down to biagi's tactical intelligence as they were the tanith battle skills. gaunt carried gar 3 on him in a data-slate file, encrypted in case the device fell into enemy hands. each time he read it adjusting the fluid disposition of his force, he admired biagi's work.  he regretted the fact that the next time he and the marshal met up, it would no doubt be to clash. it was inevitable. biagi had yet to find out that gaunt had deployed flamers. even with gar 3, it was down to the wire. the battle for the masonae district had become focused on latinate road and mason yard, with minor skirmishes along principal hi and the atmosphere processor in tesk hill square. gaunt waved beltayn over and got on the vox, moving daur's platoon and three pdf sections right up principal hi to a sub-access lane that let out into the east side of mason yard. within fifteen minutes, daur's force had the enemy's mason yard action in flank assault. gaunt's own trick to complement gar 3, based on years of experience, was to keep his forces tightly engaged with the leading edge of the enemy advance the invasive force was like an arm reaching blindly around an obstacle every time it came forward, the ghosts grabbed it by the fingers and severed it at the wrist. by staying close to that leading edge, they discouraged air-cover attacks. the locust pilots, even on low passes, even with the aid of smoke canisters and ident transponders, could not differentiate between friend or foe in the narrow, clustered streets. just before noon, stymied across a nine-block front, the invaders pulled back sharply and tried to redirect along principal hi itself. they led off this new phase with an armour charge � nine at70s and four stalk-tanks, advancing at cruise speed behind a pair of at83 brigand-pattern giants. corbec voxed urgently. the ghosts had to stay low. as they spurred on, the enemy afvs were raking the sides of the wide boulevard with their pintle-mounts and coaxial cannons. gaunt had pretty much anticipated this push. domor's squad had already laced the principal with tube-charges, the detonation of which took out one at70 and slowed the entire charge right down as the at83s lowered their dozer blades and began to clear the way. slowed down was good enough for gaunt. his next signal brought three life company vanquishers out of hiding in the warehouses beside mason yard. the wild one, the demands with menaces and the access denied, all gryphonne fv-pattern leman russ battle tanks with the trademark long guns. hurling specialist at shells, the three imperial tanks got down to business, their first three or four salvoes turning the blood pact's well-ordered chase advance into a bloody riot. the wild one crippled one of the big at83s with its first shot and killed it with its second. the at83 brigands, larger than their more primitive cousins the 70s, were, on paper, the urdeshi forge world's equivalent of the leman russ. they had auspex guidance, weapon stabilisers and torsion bar suspension. they were the blood pact's best battle machines, not counting the very few ancient super-heavies they had inherited from defeated guard units. but there was just something about the leman russ. its pedigree and reputation was second to none. when a vanquisher or conqueror appeared, the very sight of it filled imperial hearts with pride and enemy hearts with fear. this, corbec thought as he watched the engagement from a sheltered doorway, seemed to be the case now. apparently numbed at the sight of three vanquishers powering up in formation, the remaining 83 began to reverse hard. so hard, it ran into and over a stalk-tank, splintering its comparatively fragile frame. an at70 blew out under fire from the demands with menaces, and two more were rendered into scrap by the wild one. one of the stalk-tanks strutted forward past the burning carcass of the first brigand, its metal hooves chipping at the rockcrete roadway, and trained its weapon pods on the access denied. twin double-pulse lasers flickered and chattered, and blast flashes blossomed across the vanquisher's upper hull and turret. the access denied, seemingly oblivious, rolled forward, trailing smoke from burning ablative plates and scorched paintwork, and fired a single shell that disintegrated the stalk-tank's body segment so completely the port and starboard limb structures collapsed outwards, bisected. an at70 lobbed a shell at the wild one that tore away its sponson and part of its track skirt. another hit the demands with menaces on the turret destroying its vox-mast, pintle mount and laser range-finder, and killing the assistant gunner with explosive spalling. wounded but not down, the demands with menaces plunged forward, laying its guns at the reaver responsible. corbec saw the top-hatch pop and the commander emerge, oblivious to the danger, to verify aim with a handscope now his range-finder was junked. he knew his job. the demands rolled to a halt and jolted hard as it fired, jerking plumes of accumulated white dust off its surfaces and hull grooves like sifted flour. the sound of the hypervelocity at shell was just a crisp, flat clap in the augmented air. domor pointed, looking across the street into the shadowed alleys that came up through a hab compound onto the highway. corbec glimpsed movement behind the roadway's rockcrete revetment. enemy infantry. fanning forward under the cover of the tank duel. no, more than that. there were two or maybe three fire-teams over there, lugging tube launchers and long-stemmed rocket grenade bulbs. they were going for the vanquishers while they were occupied. five men� with me now! the count will be five. draw up your unit and the rest of mine and hose that far side. then follow me. a las-round had gone through guthrie's left thigh. it had cauterised itself, but he'd lost a good chunk of meat and it was so clean-through you could see daylight from the other side. corbec heard milo cry out. he started to turn. a las-round. in flight, at full velocity, passing so close beside his face that he felt its stinging heat he smelt the sheath of ozone fuming off it. if he hadn't turned his head at the sound of milo's warning, it would have hit him squarely between ear and eye. there was a third blood pact fire-team, and it had gone into cover when the first two were attacked. they had the very positive advantage of decent cover. there were six of them, counting by the muzzle flashes from the shadowed doorways and arches down the walkway. las-shots smashed into the ground and wall around the pinned imperials. chiria threw nehn flat and most probably saved his life. bonin started to fire back from the hip. milo grabbed guthrie and began to haul him towards the nearest cover� ten metres back down the walkway. corbec knew they would all be dead in seconds. automatically, nehn, chiria, bonin, milo and even guthrie, cried the same word aloud. the drilled answer-response meant their mouths would be open when the rocket fired, and therefore their eardrums wouldn't burst under the savagely unequal pressure. the bulbous rocket flared down the walkway, passing over bonin so close it scorched the fabric of his jacket's back. it entered the narrow angle of a doorway ten metres beyond and detonated. the flash was blinding, and the concussion wave brutal. fragments of stone and pieces of enemy trooper flushed out in the firewash and pelted the inside face of the roadwall. one surviving blood part trooper, caught by the edges of the blast, stumbled out into the walkway, tearing off his helmet and iron visor, screaming. bonin had been knocked flat by the concussion, but milo got up fast and aimed his lasgun. he saw the naked face of the tormented, wounded blood part soldier. hairless, pale, ear lobes and brows distended by the multiple piercings, the face brutally scarred from top to bottom with thick folds of rouched tissue. the blast had not done that. the blood part's heinous initiation rituals had made those fearful, lifetime marks. milo gasped, and fired. the red-armoured figure buckled and fell. colm? there was a loud explosion from the other side of the revetment wall. dragging corbec to his feet and leaving nehn to finish guthrie's dressing, milo, bonin and china hurried to the nearest gap. the vanquisher wild one was dead. it was hard to tell what had done the work. the remaining reavers and the at83 were throttling back down the principal, the stalk-tanks clattering away behind them. emboldened by the sight of a leman russ burning, the brigand stirred forward again, and hammered a shot at the access denied that crushed its front bracings and fore-hull plating. by now, the roadway was punctured in dozens of places by deep shell craters. the rpg shot across the highway and hit the 83 in the side turret plates. the tank shook, but came no closer to death. but the distraction had given the demands a good shot at the 83's throat. it fired, main-load at, and took the big tread's turret off with the precision of a ceremonial guillotine. the access and the demands stood their ground now on the ruined highway, whipping shells at the rapidly retreating reavers and stalk-tanks. a pall of fuel-oil burn smoke and fyceline discharge hung over the area. repeat, two. repeat, two. the reversing enemy tanks, now two hundred metres back down principal iii, were pulling over to the edges of the highway to allow something to pass. it came up monstrously fast too fast it seemed, for something so huge. access denied and demands with menaces started to retreat rapidly, slamming into full reverse. a huge shell impact ripped the demands apart catastrophically, spraying armour parts into the air on the hard tide of an expanding fireball. coming down the highway towards them was a baneblade super-heavy war tank.  all three hundred and sixteen tonnes of it were painted bright crimson, even the drive wheels and tracks, and foul symbols were inscribed along the massive hull. corbec dropped the empty launcher tube with a clatter. it had no purpose any more. just off latinate street soric dropped to his knees, panting. he cursed himself for being too old for this gak, but it didn't take away the thumping of his heart and the lactic acid burning in his leg muscles. they'd had to run. his platoon and criid's and raglon's and meryn's. the lingering infantry fight had suddenly turned on its head, just when they thought they were gaining ground. a couple of reavers, and at least three n20 halftracks with flamer mounts in their pulpits, had come steaming into the street fight, driving the imperials back. a squad of herodian pdf had tried to counter strike, and had been cooked and boiled for their efforts. running had turned into the only viable option. soric had tried hailing gaunt and tac logis to call up armour cover, but the blurting sheet-fire bursts of the enemy 'tracks seemed to be interfering with the signal. he crawled into a doorway, sucking air. men ran past. soric asked. sorry? in front of the commissar like that. vivvo frowned. soric nodded. because of� of the warp. a commissar, an inquisitor� they'd have me for buttons because of what i can do. vivvo blinked away dust and stared into soric's lined features. no. promise me you won't get in the way when it comes. he let go of vivvo's hand. soric swallowed. the sucking, rushing breath of the flamers was closer now. they could both hear the clanking of the n20 tracks. soric said, and vivvo ran off down the street. soric tugged the message shell from his pocket and opened it. what about it, agun? vivvo's right� and very forgiving too. you want to see him shot? him and kazel and hefron and everyone else who knows? shot for harbouring a piece of warp-filth? you're not telling everything. you're betraying them. be a man. tell gaunt. but the n20 was too close now. gaunt yelled into the vox-horn, but nothing except static-chopped distortion caterwauled back. rawne's platoon was holding the end of the narrow street where it joined tesk hill square. the small-arms exchange was fierce. gaunt saw feygor in cover behind a garbage drum, snapping off shots. a long hallway stretched out before him, scattered with scraps of paper and discarded clothes. on either side, numbered doors identified the separate hab modules. some were open, and despite the fact the phospha lamps were dead in their brackets, the hall was filled with thin daylight from the open rooms. nothing but the rattle and slam of fighting down below. he stepped into one open module. it was a mess. furniture was overturned, and shelves cleared. tape had been put in an x over the main window in the vain hope that it would protect the glass from blast damage. whoever lived here had left in a hurry. gaunt hoped they were tucked up safely in a civitas shelter now. he crossed to the window, keeping out of sight, and took a look. gunfire was being exchanged savagely across the open space of tesk hill square below. there were shell holes in the paving, and a five storey building on the far side of the square was on fire. the massive atmosphere processor in the centre of the open space was dented and budded by countless stray shots. several bodies lay out in the open. most, gaunt noted with satisfaction, were dad in dirty red. from his vantage point, gaunt could see a good way west across the northern sectors of the civitas. huge banks of firesmoke were puffing up from the ironhall sector. last he'd heard, before the vox went to feth, was that kaldenbach's line of defence was taking the worst of it. he hoped to terra that kaldenbach was following gar 3 too. kaldenbach, so cocksure and confident of his own abilities, had strategic ideas of his own. it would be just like him to ignore biagi's fine prep-work and choreograph his own fight. if he did, they'd all pay. further off, in the smoggy distance, he saw that enemy landers were still dipping in over the obsidaes. the downpour of drop-pods had all but ceased, but the landers still came on, ferrying men and munitions down, retreating empty, refuelling and repeating the process. gaunt had, for obvious reasons, a basic faith in the guard being the backbone of the imperium's fighting power. he had a healthy respect for the astartes, for the titan legions, for the armoured regiments and the navy, but the basic fething infantry was, in his book, the four square basis of victory. that's the way he'd been taught, after all, by his father, by oktar, by slaydo� even by dercius. but right then, like never before, he longed for a squadron of furies, or lightnings, or anything air-mobile with a good rate of climb and armour-penetrator ammunition. those landers were so vulnerable. one well led squadron could exterminate a huge chunk of the enemy strength in transit before it had even made surface-touch. it would be like a gamebird shoot. sir! sorry to spook you, banda. gaunt nodded. rawne shrugged slightly. rawne nodded. gaunt? gaunt nodded, and hit the stairs. the spring door banged shut after him. rawne wandered back into the module. at the window, banda was lining up her long-las. her breathing dropped to a very low rate. rawne asked. she turned and smiled sardonically at him. gaunt asked. with his own platoon, and nailer's and raglon's, gaunt set off away from tesk hill, into the middle streets of the masonae district. the scouts moved ahead � caober, mkeller and preed. preed was suth's replacement in seventeen. an older tanith, he'd steadfastly remained a regular trooper until mkoll had urged him to specialise. in his previous life as a gamekeeper, he'd developed great woodcraft, but he'd not joined the scout fraternity because of a lack of confidence. he thought himself too old. gaunt hoped preed was not finding his true calling too late. half a kilometre east of tesk hill, they ran into trouble. a serious wedge of blood pact infantry was biting down around hisson street, trying to break through to principal iii. the platoons commanded by skerral, folore, mkendrick and burone � respectively nineteen, twenty-six, eighteen and seven � were packing a splendid but tight resistance to that attack. but the neighbourhood streets were no go. haller nodded. caober consulted his data-slate chart. the interior of the manufactory was cold and dark. generally, the air in the masonae district had become increasingly stale, so much so that many of the ghosts were wearing their rebreathers. too many atmosphere processors knocked out of action, gaunt thought. the machine shops and assembly sheds were quiet. as they moved along, they checked every side door and storeroom, just in case. they exited the manufactory and crossed via a covered walkway into the worker habitat. the procedure resumed. a careful checking of rooms to cover their backs as they crossed the hab's lower halls. gaunt approached, the ghosts behind him down in cover, weapons raised. he turned the door handle. caober furrowed his brow in surprise. gaunt threw the door open and they looked in, guns aimed. another hab module, standard, except� .. this one was entirely bare. no carpet or rugs, no shade on the overhead lamp, walls stripped. a door to one side, closed. move forward� gaunt hissed. he had a terribly uneasy feeling. he walked into the bare room, and smelt its musty cool. what was going on? some kind of coincidence? he walked to the small table oddly set in the centre of the room, and reached out to the book lying there. it was old. so very old, it was falling apart and dissolving into dust. he opened the cover and read the title page. it was a first edition of on the use of armies by marchese. gaunt had his own copy of this obscure work. tactician biota had given it to him just before he'd left aexe cardinal. what the hell �? what gross coincidence was this? gaunt felt a rising sense of panic and fear. warp magic was around him. he looked at the closed side door. what was beyond that? what? he stepped towards it, and turned the handle. the door opened gently. gaunt smelled fresh, clean air. there were plants in the doorway. climbers and shrubs. caober yelled from the doorway, and started to fire. gaunt slammed the door shut and ran to join him. a blood pact platoon was coming to meet them down the hab hallway, using doorways for cover and firing their lasrifles and solid-slug weapons. it took ten minutes of brutal fighting to kill them. by the time the fight was over, gaunt was at the east exit of the hab. he thought for a second about going back to that strange, bare room, but it didn't seem to matter so much anymore. his blood was up. he'd just impaled a blood pact officer on his power sword. and by the time the three platoon group was out and into fancible street, he'd forgotten entirely about the old book and the bare room. gol kolea dropped down out of the hab window onto the slip-road beneath and ran forty metres, fast, towards the rear wall of the dingy store-barn facing him. every black, glass-less window along the road staring down on him seemed to hold the threat of hidden shooters, but no fire came his way. he was breathing hard by the time he crunched against the gritty wall and slid down, but he could still hear the clattering rattle of a belt-fed weapon nearby. dafelbe was trying to raise him on the vox, demanding to know his position. the link was very bad, very chopped. kolea could only just make dafelbe out. kolea flicked the mic of his comm-link twice in quick succession, the nonverbal acknowledgement, the can't talk now. he crawled to the end of the store-barn's retaining wall and then quickly swung up over the low barrier, firing from the chest. two blood pact troopers, their backs to him at the next wall line, toppled over, taken completely by surprise. he ducked back down. more belt-fed rattling. some shouting now. a couple of shots whined over him. chancing it, he took a dash towards the looming doorway of the barn and threw himself into cover. renewed shouts, in a harsh language that made him cringe. he worked his way down the inside wall in the gloom, up onto a loading dock, and across to a shell hole in the wall. the fractured puncture gave him a view out into the freight yard behind the barn. from there, he could see the two-man team with the belt-fed cannon, nestled behind a stack of prefab rockcrete sheets. he could see them, but the firing angle was lousy. he needed to be higher� a metal ladder, secured to the wall on brackets, led up from the loading dock to a first floor stowage platform. slinging his lasgun over his shoulder, he went up the ladder. he was just climbing off onto the stowage decking when he realised he wasn't alone. he threw himself forward as the figure came for him out of the dark, and they tumbled over together, grunting and thrashing. his opponent was quick, and kolea got a warning glimpse of a bared blade. a flash of steel in the dimness. gak to that. kolea put all his upper body strength into a hooking punch and slammed the figure away onto its back. he darted forward to finish the business scratch-company style, with his bare hands, and pulled up. it was cuu. cuu hissed. that, disturbingly, didn't ring true to kolea at all. cuu had been up on the platform before kolea, so his eyes would have had longer to adjust to the gloom. surely, he should have been able to tell� unless he'd chosen not to. a quick slash with a warknife, and who'd have known better? kolea shook himself. lijah as cuu rose, oathing and hawking bloody phlegm, kolea crossed to the ventilator window in the wall, levered open the metal louvres, and looked out. down below, at a steeper but better angle, he saw the gun-nest. he slid the barrel of his lasrifle through the louvres and took aim, even though he was going to fire on auto. his shots rained down over the gun-position. the gunner himself flopped back dead at once. the platoon was moving up through the freight yard when they got down. he asked lubba. lubba was adjusting the feeder pipe of his flamer's p-tanks. criid's order echoed down the concourse. they hurried to join her. it was a false alarm. vari's platoon was coming in from the next street over. and they seem to have a stalktank � criid asked. baen hunched his shoulders in a �what can i tell you?' fine by me, nessa, hwlan, baen� with kolea. she took aim, her breathing slowing. she fired. the hot-shot round ruptured the belly-bubble and blew the psyker's head and shoulders into meat shrapnel. the stalk-tank itself shuddered and then started to burn. a nonverbal scream shrilled into the air and made them all recoil and gasp. kolea, baen and hwlan got back up to the window and began firing down on the rapidly breaking blood pact units. criid and varl took advantage of the confusion and pressed in. in under five minutes, they had the street cleared. the crimson baneblade was a horrifying thing, terror made into physical form. corbec doubted the fething archon himself, urlock wassissname, would have more presence in person. the sound it made was enough. not a growl, not a rumble, not a roar. a profoundly deep, almost infrasonic howl that vibrated the diaphragm and narrowed the soul. someone � daur maybe, or ana curth � had once told corbec that infra-sound noise, down around the 18hz level, triggered a primaeval fear-response in humans. it was as old as caves and darkness and the first fire the infrasonic rumble in the snarls of old terra hunter-fields made humans freeze with terror. it was a base response, inherited from the primates. when it fired its main gun, or its hull-mounted demolisher cannon, it was worse. the ground quaked. shells seared away into the mid-city and fireballs bloomed up over the roofline. there was nothing he could do against that. his assault team was ready to flee into the eastern streets. china asked. corbec turned to look. a figure was striding out onto the highway in front of the super-heavy tank. she was dad in golden armour and a sword glittered in her hand. milo stared. he had not yet got over the shock of the pilgrim girl's death. he could see her still, in his mind's eye, running out in front of the tank, waving her arms to distract it. corbec yelled, but milo was already running out of cover. corbec added, as he shook off chiria's hands and went after him. milo ran out onto the highway. the beati didn't seem to see him. god- emperor, but she looked so beautiful in her gilded, engraved armour. he cried out. a second later, corbec crashed into him and brought him down with a flying tackle. they both bruised hard on the road surface. the baneblade's coaxial sub-weapons swung to target the golden figure ahead of it and blazed away, but the saint was no longer there. the vacant stretch of roadway ripped up in a messy blitz. with a single leap, she had come up onto the fore-hull of the huge vehicle, behind the squat demolisher mount and beside the main weapon. her sword scythed in her hand. the massive main barrel severed, the cut length of it crashing onto the hull before rolling off onto the ground. the beati swung her sword up, grabbed the hilt with both hands and plunged it down, blade-first, between her well-planted feet, deep into the body of the tank's main hull. it slewed to a stop. she had pin-pointed and executed the driver. the top-hatch popped and a crew commander scrambled up, grabbing the yokes of the pintle-mounted bolter. she leapt again, somersaulting, and landed on her feet on the turret-top behind his hatch. the beati unclasped a golden tube-charge from her belt, thumbed off the spring and dropped it down into the open hatch. then she dived headlong off the top of the tank. milo and corbec started running for cover. the baneblade did not explode, but fire gusted through its heart, and blew off several hatches. one crewman staggered out, burning, and fell onto the highway. sword hanging low from her right hand, the beati walked towards them, gleaming in her armour, backlit by the burning tank. they both found themselves smiling. corbec glanced at milo. he was amazed. the boy really didn't see it. this was sanian, a girl milo had spent years dreaming about. but he didn't recognise her, face to face. but, when he came to think of it, corbec realised he wouldn't have recognised her either. he only knew it was sanian because gaunt had told him so. this woman, this creature, was nothing like the esholi he'd met on hagia. sanian had been quiet, modest, restrained. this female blazed with confidence, power and drive. and, while sanian had been a treat for the eyes, the woman before them was beautiful. so beautiful it hurt. she was luminous. beyond sex, beyond desire. a divine incarnation of beauty. and she'd just killed a super-heavy tank outright in single combat. milo started to say something and then brought his lasrifle up rapidly, aiming � so it appeared � right at her head. he fired, and the shot went over her left shoulder. the baneblade crewman, bolt pistol raised, was half-out of the dead tank's side hatch, his weapon levelled at the beati's back. milo's shot hit him in the throat and he fell down on his face, the gun clattering to the deck. the beati flinched and looked round. when she turned back to look at milo, she was smiling broadly. a raging headache he had not even begun to acknowledge, the after-effects of the baneblade's awful infrasound, faded and vanished. he felt good. feth! corbec assured her. she turned to look at him and smiled again. she asked. he shook his head. gaunt and his force arrived on principal iii a few minutes later. gaunt stared in amazement at the ruined super-heavy. gaunt frowned. and it would be longer, and without end. the imperials had barely held back the archenemy's first wave, and the second was coming hard on its heels. there would be no break in this fight the enemy would assault the civitas until it fell. corbec's platoon meandered back through empty streets towards the inner guard stations, sandbagged emplacements manned by regiment civitas and pdf along the guild slope. dorden and curth had set up shop in a vacant livestock hall. corbec sent his injured in that direction, but he was distracted. he'd heard something. a sound from his past, nostalgic eddying out of a hab across from the hall. he walked over, and ducked into the hab. that noise! the shriek of a woodsaw. that dusty smell, that memory� there was a stack of seasoned timber just inside the low door. pale stuff with a fine bloom. corbec ran his fingers along the grain. he'd forgotten how much the smell and feel of wood had been part of his life. corbec turned and peered into the dark interior of the building. an old man with sawdust flakes in his wiry hair was feeding planks into a table saw beneath the light of a single phospha lamp. the old man frowned as if he didn't know what to say to that, and hefted up another board in his gloved hands. corbec scratched his head, looking around. he hit the rubber-sleeved switch on the side of the table saw and powered it down so they could talk without raising their voices. he tore some pulp-paper freight wrapping away from a small consignment of dark wood. it was dusty. it hadn't been touched in a while. corbec bent down beside him and knew immediately what he was looking at. quality timber had been tanith's one major export. he'd worked the mills himself, years back, rough cutting wood for off-world shipment. the fierce fighting in the northern sectors of the civitas did not abate. it lit the darkness with its flashes and beams. deeper into the city heart, thousands of yellow fires flickered and glowed, the legacy of the shelling and the constant airstrikes. every few minutes, locusts loomed out of the closing darkness and streaked over the civitas at low level, dropping payloads or firing cannons. beyond, in the obsidaes, the invasion force continued to land. the belly lamps of landers, frost white, burning in the air like flares. rigs of phospha lamps had been built around makeshift drop points and, under their glare, as the cold night wind rose in the desert, armour columns assembled under marshals, and infantry brigades formed up. the glass fields were bright with circles of brilliance. locust formations criss-crossed the area at speed. massive transports came in, raising walls of dust, and shook the soil with their land fall. iris valve belly hatches yawned open along their fat flanks and they gave birth to litters of stalk-tanks. others landed, ramp mouths open like basking crocodilians, and lines of tracked armour, apcs, self-propelled guns and gref-carriers spewed from them onto the dusty plain. overhead, the low, baleful stars of the watching enemy warships shone. saul, the marksman, entered the city through the glassworks sector. he spent most of the first day shadowing the frontline forces as they ploughed into the civitas, street by street. saul had no aversion to fighting, but assault scrapping was not his business here on herodor, so he preferred not to get his hands dirty. he left the slog to the death-brigades and the armour. he spoke to no one, for he was preparing his mind for the task the magister had set him, but he kept his helmet link open and listened throughout the day to the comm-traffic of his own forces. occasionally, he retuned to the enemy channel. it was meant to be encrypted, but their tech-mages had broken the imperial cryptography in the first few hours of the assault. saul spoke low gothic fluently. he found it useful to understand the chatter of the weak souls he preyed on. when, in the middle part of the day, his forces had launched their jamming weapons, he'd been frustrated to lose the imperial signal. it was back on again now. this pleased him, even though it meant the enemy must have taken out at least a few of the specialist psyker vehicles. by nightfall, he had reached the junction of principal vi and brazen street. he knew this from his chart-slate. the tech mages in the first wave had almost literally ripped detailed street plans and schematics from the civitas' tac logis data banks, which were protected by laughably crude protection programs. the information flowed from the tech-mages on the surface back to the warships, where it was collated and transmitted back down to any one with the appropriate field gear. that meant officers, squad leaders, tank chiefs and saul. a constantly updating, constantly refining picture of the city was made available to him on his hand-held. the imperials had fought well on that first day, to give them their credit. they'd held onto the masonae and ironhall districts, though it had cost them. by morning, saul was certain, it would be a different picture. in the glassworks, the imperials had been broken three times during the course of daylight, falling back on each occasion and redoubling their resistance. monitoring the comm lines, saul had learned that the glassworks was defended in the main by local pdf and regiment civitas soldiers. their area commander was a colonel called vibreson. this vibreson was doing well in a bad situation. nightfall had his forces stalling the blood pact push along brazen street and the glass road hab estates. the death-brigade units saul had been shadowing all day were now dug in and stationary. that didn't suit saul at all. he needed to get on, deeper into the city, where his goal awaited him. he realised the time had come to make an opening for himself. the marksman sat down on a kerb beside a torched hab, just a few hundred metres from the fierce front of the fight, and took out his chart. he scrolled the specific map reference onto the little screen and studied it as he listened to the enemy's channel. blood pact units moved up past him, and he ignored them. the night was coming down, and that was his hour, a time to capitalise on shadows and move forward. night could get him within rifle-range of the target, and then he could simply wait, still and silent like just another corpse, until the moment came. saul switched channels and listened for a while to his own side's chatter.  officers, using the name of the magister as a threat and a promise, were screaming for more armour to push up into the brazen street defences and crack them. saul smiled. that was no good. the imperials were too well established. their line would hold for a good time yet. it would hold against force, that was. against physical attack. but saul had murderous experience of war. their line would not hold against fear and confusion. not for a moment. fear and confusion would do in a minute what it would take a full motor division a day to accomplish. he flicked back to the imperial channel. the imperials �those poor fools � so loved their code names. they thought they were so clever. drumroll was needed at casten street. drumroll was moving with twelve platoon up to ravenor crossing. would drumroll approve the repositioning of pdf eleven to the sespre aqueduct? idiots. it was like a child's game, trying to hide the truth from adults. that was always the imperial failing. they regarded the armies of the warp as scum, so they also assumed they were stupid. saul looked at his slate. he took off his right glove and traced the line of principal vi with a scar-disfigured middle finger. he kept his right index finger curled protectively against his palm. it was the only part of his hands that was not ritual-scarred. it was his trigger finger, after all. the chapel of kiodrus. there it was. a temple raised to the memory of some half-arsed commander who had stood with the saint in the early times. apparently, that made him a big deal. saul got to his feet and tucked his slate in his thigh pouch. he put his glove back on and picked up his long-las. it took him twenty minutes to skirt round the back of the habs, avoiding his own forces as much as the enemy, before he came out onto principal vi. he could see the chapel, a tall, dignified place raised from ashlar. its facade was dented with shell holes. las crossfire whipped across the roadway in front of it. smoke hazed the early night air. saul crossed to a hab on the other side of the wide avenue, keeping low, and knocked the entry door off its hinges with a single kick. the building was dirty and stale. the stench of decomposing food wafted from the shared larders on each block level. the marksman went up five flights and broke into a hab apartment. a glance told him the window view wasn't quite right, so he went back out and up another floor. better. he slid the window up and braced it with a leg he snapped off a chair. then he lined up. saul fired up his scope. it whirred and blinked, then the image resolved. in green and black, light-boosted, high res. he panned around. the front of the chapel. the side. the alley beside it. the barricades. now he got winks of brilliant light las-fire. the muzzle flash of several cannons. he adjusted the scope's glare setting. he saw figures. imperials. dark blobs. pdf and regiment civitas, manning the defences, invisible from the street behind the solid defences, but oh so vulnerable from this lofty viewpoint. so much for your silly code names, saul thought. fear and confusion. more devastating than a full motor division. the pdf around the chapel panicked when their beloved leader went down. in under fifteen minutes, that panic turned into a fatal flaw. rushed by death-brigades, the line broke. it broke at six other places along the principal at roughly the same time. headless, the imperial defenders went into a mindless spiral and were slaughtered. by midnight, the invaders had smashed their way into the civitas as far as loman street, just a few blocks short of astronomer's circle, deep in the western sectors of the city. saul followed the tide, walking in its bloody wake through burning streets piled with pdf dead. just after midnight alone and on foot he pushed past the front-line of his own forces and slipped away into the dark streets of the mid-city and the guild slope. the rapidly retreating, badly organised imperial defences were easy to avoid. the target awaited him. the war grumbled far above him like someone else's nightmare. leg-mounts splashing through warm water, karess advanced. where the limestone chambers became too tight and encumbering, he used his cutting beams to burn them smooth and open. the reek of cooked stone and ash filled the air. karess couldn't smell it. he couldn't feel the heat. he felt nothing but the machine-induced pain of his being. he strode forward, metre by metre, into the belly of the civitas. i need you to mount a counter-guard. here, here and here. lamm moved his units forward through the emptied city streets towards the swell of fire light that marked the archenemy advance. they had all switched to rebreathers. too many processors had been choked and destroyed in the invasion. fanning out his overstretched forces reached principal ii and some of them engaged. lamm broke into a hab unit and went up to the top floor with a vox man and three of his officers to get a good overview. lamm knelt at the sill of an upper floor window and swung his field glasses over the burning, dying civitas below. fires and explosions showed up as points of white light so bright they baffled the instrument's filters. the crackly voice made lamm jump. it came from the vox-caster. it was leaning against the wall, straps dangling. there was no sign of the vox-man who had been carrying it. there was another noise from the bathroom. lamm raised his pistol and fired at the door. the las-round punched a hole in the fibre-board. light shone through it. with the snout of his pistol, he pushed the bathroom door open. the overhead light was on, shade-less, bright, harsh. lamm found forbes and his three officers. they were in the moulded plastic bathtub. they had been stripped of their clothes and their skins and of all semblance of articulation. the tub was full to the brim with a thick, gleaming bouillabaisse of blood and meat and bones and organs. blood trickled down the side onto the tiled floor. lamm gasped in disbelief then fell to his knees and vomited. he heard a swish behind him, in the dark. it was the swish of a cloak. a cloak of wet, human skin. lamm rolled and fired, blasting shot after shot against the far wall of the room. he stopped firing and rose, gun clenched in a shaking hand. his own breath rasped in his ears. he swung the gun round, left and right. had he killed it? had he? lamm's chest suddenly felt warm. he blinked and raised his hand. his chest was awash with thick, hot blood. his hand went up to his throat and two of his fingers unexpectedly went in through a slit in the flesh that hadn't been there ten seconds before. his fingertips nudged his exposed larynx, neck tendons and oesophagus. his throat had been cut. he felt no real pain, just enormous surprise. skarwael finished his artistry. his boline, double-bladed, each edge mono-molecular sharp, punched into lamm's teetering, choking form. he revealed the length of the spine while the man was still standing upright, and cut down through his kidneys and lumbar muscles. blood squirted out under pressure. skarwael opened his mouth and stuck out his long, grey tongue as it spattered over him. lamm fell over onto his face. skarwael smeared the blood on his cheeks up and around his deep eye sockets. it made them seem even blacker and deeper against his stretched, white flesh. he sighed. he would not be so patient and merciful with the beati. pater sin hushed his eyeless charges and cuddled them to his sides. they were walking down the middle of principal i in the dark, fires around them, and the runt psykers were skittish. they were right in the middle of the wide highway. figures emerged from cover ahead of them. imperial men. their lasguns were raised. they shouted challenges, certain no enemy would approach so brazenly and out in the open. a shell-shocked pilgrim and his children, in desperate need of help, wandering blind� that's who they were� sin leant down and whispered into the ears of his runts and they trembled. they opened their wet, slit mouths wide. a deep buzzing filled the air. the imperial troopers came to a halt and turned to look at one another dimly. then they opened fire. within five seconds they were all dead, comrade killed by comrade. the little malformed creatures closed their mouths and sin used the hem of his silk robes to dab the spittle away from the corners of their mouths. then he took them by the hands, one on each side, and led them on past the scattered bodies. the psykers stumbled, reluctant, like very young children. one began to open and close its mouth in a soft, agitated manner. the other had his free arm up and crooked, and was waving his hand back and forth next to his ear. mkendrick? mkendrick? where the feth are you? � rawne a few minutes before sunrise on the second day, from his command post high in the hives, lugo sent out the order to withdraw. with the north-western suburbs of the civitas wide open, the ironhall district came under increasing pressure during the second half of the night, and kaldenbach had finally, reluctantly, signalled that his forces could no longer hold onto it. when the order reached gaunt, he cursed even though he saw the sense of it. if kaldenbach fell back, the masonae would be left alone, a salient vulnerable to the pincer of the archenemy forces flowing in around it. the northern civitas sectors had to be given up. fortunately, kaldenbach was a sound leader and a man of method. he did not simply throw his overstretched forces into flight. he knew the vital importance of a measured retreat, knew that ground must be given only for tactical consolidation. he coordinated with gaunt so that the entire line could be withdrawn as cleanly as possible, supplying mutual cover and support. it was a tough and bloody process, and it took five hours. on more than a dozen occasions, it nearly failed. twice, pdf armour on the glassworks flank retreated too fast, without provisioning cover for the infantry sections north of it, and created gaps that kaldenbach managed to plug through the narrowest of luck. then a charge of enemy afvs against kaldenbach's own command section almost managed a coup de grace which was only held off by an improvised counter-strike by men of the regiment civitas. gaunt's withdrawing sections were harried by airstrikes, three of which damaged the line badly and led to precarious moments of redeployment as invader units tried to capitalise on the weaknesses. then daur's units were sent east along farkindle street to take the pressure off a brace of platoons trying to withdraw under fire, but found their route impossibly blocked by a streetwide firestorm. raglon's platoon, already backed into a certain measure of safety, extemporised courageously, and pushed forward again, in time to provide the cover daur had been prevented from supplying. any one of these near-disasters might have cut a hole in the retreating guard line, and that would have quickly ensured a miserable doom for every soldier in the withdrawing forces. in the hour before noon, under a pale sky leaden with the smoke of the burning outer city, the last of gaunt's and kaldenbach's forces reached the defences of the guild slope and were absorbed into the second line. to their north, at their heels, the monstrous regiments of the archenemy surged down through the abandoned suburbs to begin the concentrated assault of the guild slope. the second phase of the battle for the civitas beati had begun. shells and other ranged munitions were now falling on the inner city, and striking the hive towers too. the explosions dotting the vast faces of the soaring hives seemed like match-sparks on the slopes of mountains, but the damage was progressive. heavier artillery was advanced from the obsidaes to positions inside the captured north up-city. the enemy's airpower also began to concentrate its attacks on the hive superstructures. anti-fighter batteries on the roofs and upper levels of all four hive towers, most of them hastily erected during the previous days, set up brusque resistance. from the guild slope, the display was intense, even if smoke cover frequently obscured it: the attack craft, zipping and circling like flies through air striped and fretted with tracer and laser fire and the blossom of detonations. other sounds rolled in across the civitas too: ghastly sounds. filthy proclamations of warp-texts were flooding the vox channels, or being broadcast from the speakers of advancing armour at high volume. the fallen prayer horn, gorgonaught, was set back on its shot-up tower and directed at the hives. through it, obscenity was blasted, often the amplified screams of imperial troops, citizens or pilgrims captured during the first phase. the aural assault chilled and unsettled the already rattled and weary defenders, life company commissars � the keetle twins especially � were kept busy chastening, by execution, those soldiers whose mettle broke under the psychological torment. for it became hard to think. it became hard to want to be alive. by the early afternoon, though the effects of the noise bombardment had yet to fully penetrate the interior of the hive towers, all those in the open guild slope and mid-city, including the bulk of the defenders, were sweating and sick. nerves were frayed, stomachs acid and swilling. even so, they had to fight on. the death-brigades assaulted the guild slope from north-east and northwest. at the barricades, defence lines and strong points. imperial troopers fought and died with tears in their eyes, driven to anguish by the sputtering, hissing sounds of evil incarnate. soric had stopped reading the message shell notes that came to him. the writing had become increasingly spidery and frantic, and where it was legible, it was simply abuse. he was a weak fool. he was a coward. he was gakking scum. the author, whatever it was, whatever part of him it might be, had become incoherent and desperate. he rested his platoon for fifteen minutes between artillery barrages, and sat on his own in a doorway, hunched up, hands twitching, smoking a lhostick. there was a taste of bile in his mouth that would not go away, and his eye kept watering. he kept looking for hark. hark knew. soric had been a brave man all his life. for all the sickness and fear he felt, now more than ever he knew milo had been right. soric just had to be brave enough now to do it the right way. soric shouted as he got up and squashed the stub underfoot. but soric was already thumping away down the street. filmy grey smoke from tank shelling wafted down the narrow roadway in the guild slope. ornate guild-owned warehouses stood on either side of the cobbled lane, and to the south, up the gentle incline, the colossal masses of the hive towers rose above the rooftops. there was little, varl considered, that distinguished this particular street from the one immediately north of it, or the one directly south. they were all part of the mid-city maze, all shell-pummelled and smoke-choked.  this street, however, marked the second line, the defensive ring around the mid-city to which all imperial forces had withdrawn. more particularly, this street was the assigned part of the second line that was his platoon's duty to hold. a block away to the west was a company of pdf riflemen. a block to the east, varl had it on good authority � well , tac logis at least � was a quartet of life company tanks. he hadn't seen them, but he trusted they were there. since noon, it had been quiet in his immediate neighbourhood, apart from the echoing torment of the archenemy's broadcasts and a single push-assault from a blood pact death-brigade that his men had discouraged with their excellently positioned enfilade. varl took a squint down the street where the men of number nine platoon were all in cover, waiting. he saw baen, his platoon's scout, hurrying back to him from a foray down to the crossroads. pater sin and his two charges were walking in step behind baen. varl slid a lho-stick out of his jacket pocket and held it out to brostin, in cover beside him. brostin obligingly singed the tip of his sergeant's smoke with the hot-blue pilot light of his flamer. drawing deep and exhaling, varl nodded to baen as he drew close. the pater and the psykers were virtually at baen's heels. varl asked. sin placed his massive hands firmly on the shoulders of his two runts and walked them forward. varl smiled. sin paused, and kept his psykers huddled close to him as he stepped back and gazed into varl's face. he recognised the man's uniform. tanith. these men were ghosts. the ones who had robbed him of his victory on hagia. he'd come so close there, and had only escaped with his life thanks to a warning from his guide psykers. very few of his breed had escaped hagia alive. resentment and vengeance simmered inside him. sin's lips curled back from his implanted steel fangs. these were the wretches who had denied him. this one, a sergeant by his markings, slovenly, casual, disfigured by an augmetic shoulder. a worthless little bastard who� for a moment, sin almost let the psyk-cloak drop so they could see him. he could kill them all, slaughter them, turning their own guns on them. but patience and devotion to his sworn duty kept him true he'd over-taxed his children already, and he wanted them strong and refreshed for the work ahead. they were tired, and that made them harder to control. one of them persisted in waving his hand. masking was easier than goading, otherwise he'd have turned this street into a charnel place to make passage. besides, his revenge on the tanith would be total when his work was complete these men would all be dead soon. better still, they would die stripped of all hope and faith. he led his children away, up the climbing street. they crossed three more blocks, ignored by the imperial defenders, and then turned directly south. sin put his hands flat on the tops of his psykers' heads. they both winced and murmured. sin felt his way. he was close enough now. he hurried the pair of them off the roadway into a covered market. the produce shops were all closed up and shuttered, and wooden screens had been partially raised to protect the glass roof. he led the runts down the tiled walkway of one of the marketplace's aisles, and then crouched them down behind a buttonmaker's cart. sin soothed them with his low, sweet moaning, and lulled them into a calm, trance state by repeated use of their ritual command words. they both became motionless. outside, tank rounds from the latest wave of blood pact assault whizzed and thumped into the nearby manufactories. small-arms fire rattled and cracked up the open street. leyr cried, more insistently. rawne lashed around, blood dripping from his nose. his fist caught leyr around the side of the head and smacked the scout to the ground. feygor lunged, leaping over the sprawled leyr and crashing into rawne. he brought the major down hard in the doorway, nudging the wooden door open. enemy fire, fierce and unabating, smashed into the door and its surround, filling the air with wood chips and dust. rawne had landed on his back. prone, he lashed out a kick with both legs that propelled feygor, doubled up, right across the room, and also flipped rawne back onto his feet. caffran came in fast from the side, throwing a punch that rawne blocked with a raised forearm. caffran rallied with another smash, and rawne turned that away with a hard, open palm, sidestepping caffran's third blow, and elbowed the trooper in the throat. caffran fell down on all fours, gasping. leyr was up again by then, swinging a hook at the side of rawne's head. rawne grabbed the scout's wrist and twisted so hard it almost broke. leyr cried out in pain, and fell to his knees. feygor dubbed rawne across the shoulders and neck with both fists locked together. rawne staggered, blood flying from his nose. he swung out with a side kick that threw feygor back against the wall, and then turned and staggered towards the door. banda brought him down. she rolled rawne over under her, and pressed her straight silver to his neck. caff? jessi? murt? what the feth was i just doing�? sin cooed at them. find one, find one� find the one who will serve and mark him out. imprint him. brand him with the purpose. make him the instrument � brand that one! rocket grenades slammed into the buildings west of them, and in their wake came a ripple of mortar rounds. milo heard domor yelling for his platoon to fall back. milo got up and led the beati after them. all around the vaunted second line, the imperials were withdrawing now. before nightfall, it would be street righting right back through the guild slope towards the hives. they were losing. fighting hard, fighting well, but losing anyway. milo and sabbat got into cover, hearing the dank of advancing enemy tanks and the crunch of broken walls driven over under churning treads. sabbat frowned. asked the beati. she nodded. another rpg fell close to them and blew in a wall ten paces from where they were concealed. milo gasped. shoggy! get them dug in. somehow oblivious to � or invulnerable to � the shells and crossfire drumming around them, she led milo through the devastated streets to a small civitas chapel whose roof had been taken off by the recent efforts of the archenemy. the chapel had been dedicated to faltomus. the cracked rafters smouldered, and the floor was littered with chafstone tiles and broken pews. she beckoned him forward across the debris until they were standing in front of the aquila altarblock. milo's head throbbed and rolled. he could hear how close to the bloody front of the fight they were. why had she brought him here? she was so vital, so valuable. she was taking such a risk. this was crazy� with gentle hands, she turned his dirty face towards the altar and pressed the middle three fingers of her right hand against his brow. in a second, a single wonderful second of glass-cold clarity, his headache cleared and he saw everything. everything. they settled to their knees before the altar. saul sucked in his breath. the tagger points of his scope now blinked on empty space. just a second before, he'd had a near-perfect shot. the broken lancet window looking into the chapel of faltornus, five hundred metres , negligible cross-wind� no adjustment he couldn't make. for a while, she'd been screened by the boy, the young guard trooper, who'd kept getting in the line of sight. saul was confident one of his custom rounds would penetrate the boy's body and waste the beati too, but he didn't want to risk it. neither did he want the impurity. he wanted a clean head-shot the beati. in his sights. as the magister would have wanted it. one shot. but the bloody boy would not get out of the way. not until the last minute, when he had disappeared suddenly below the level of the broken sill. kneeling, presumably. for one brief moment, the beati was exposed, a clear shot through the broken lancet. then she too dropped from view beside the boy. what were they doing? praying, he supposed. as if that would do any good now. saul slid his long-las back from the gap. the hab he was in was almost a kilometre long, bridging over six guild slope streets, and there were windows all along it. he could easily slip down to another firing position and get her on the way back up. saul started to gather his kit up and paused. he suddenly felt that rush only a sniper ever feels. he ducked. six hundred plus metres west, hlaine larkin raised his aim and sighed. he could have sworn he'd seen something at that hab window. a shooter lining up. gone now. saul snuggled up against a window five arches down and took the scope off his gun. he peered out, using the device free, like a telescope. there was the chapel. still no movement. he waited. how long does a prayer last? he couldn't shake off that feeling, that six sense rush.  just to be safe, he dropped back to the next window. he scoped again. this time, a movement. the briefest suggestion of heads. he fitted his scope back onto his long-las and rolled over to the window's far corner, lining up. the prayer finished, milo and sabbat rose back into view. he saw her nod to him and say something. saul had his shot. clean� no , the boy was in the way again. if he leant out further� there he was! larkin tensed and then slumped back. he snarled into his vox-link. saul's unscarred finger began to squeeze the trigger. there was a crackwhine, a distant echo, and for one glorious moment saul thought he'd fired. but the counter on his lasgun still read full. exploded by a hot-shot round, saul's head came away entirely. his corpse, smoking at the neck, fell back into the hab. the long-las clattered from his hands, unfired. jajjo voxed gleefully. kneeling beside him, in the shelter of the dorm window, nessa bourah raised her smoking long-las and grinned. the recirculated air in the tarif street triage was clammy, and stank of chemicals. a stream of trucks, driven by civilian volunteers, nosed into the yard, shirting the mobile wounded back to the infirmaries in the hives. gaunt pushed his way in through the crowds of casualties. screams and moans and frantic voices came at him from all sides. several orderlies were lifting hark onto a trolley for evacuation to the hives. gaunt could barely see the commissar under the plastic hood of the medical respirator and the sterile packing wadded to his left side. dorden asked darkly. grell said it was like a butcher's shop. he held it out. several objects lay in it, matted with blood. the ward room was reserved for the most seriously injured, including those that dorden didn't dare move. the doctor led gaunt over to a corner bunk where a tanith trooper lay on vital support. it was costin, the drunk whose carelessness had damaged raglon's platoon so badly on aexe. gaunt nodded. he was proud of them. they'd improvised a cover action when daur had been cut off, and in doing so had saved more than seventy men. gaunt looked at dorden. dorden snarled, turning away. dorden stopped. gaunt was stunned. both gaunt and dorden remembered the incident well. it had indeed rattled them. but it's you, agun, and i've never heard of a warp-freak turning himself in. duty troopers? escort him to the hives and lock him down in the securest cell they have. if he tries anything, shoot him. dorden asked. felt like it had hold of my mind. i wasn't me anymore. if i hadn't shaken it off, colm. feth. domor yelled, and the platoon rose and charged, surging up around the defiant beati, meeting the enemy head on. milo ran forward, his head pounding. he lanced his rifle-mounted warknife into the face of the nearest blood pact trooper, twisting it to pull it free. he saw her. she looked so vulnerable. just one shot one last shot and she'd be finished. he threw himself against the enemy tide. the last dregs of fading daylight filtered slantwise through the partially shuttered glass hoarding of the covered market and gleamed off pater sin's steel teeth as he mouthed soothing words to his twins. they had done their work. they were linked to the instrument and with each passing moment they were imprinting the task deeper and deeper into its mind. the twins were the most potent psykers in the sector. they were alpha level. between them, their combined minds packed more power than all the astropaths and psykers on herodor, imperial and foe alike. his children. the children of sin. karess was submerged now, ten metres deep in chalybeate spring water that pushed at him, heavy with current. beads of escaped gas twinkled along the seams of his adamite casing and around the perforated cowls of his heavy weapons. his auditory tracts rippled with the swoosh of aquatic pressure. the rock base of the aquifer was soft, and karess' massive hooves churned up silt and eyeless mote-creatures, bacterium and thermal scum. machine-pain thrummed through his superstructure. he checked his positioning systems. true south, true south. there, he would rise and kill. tifeh was dead. the human's bullet had lodged deep inside it and killed it. chto, who had brood command, ordered reghh to let tifeh drop. the cold, rank body slipped to the ground. chto and reghh stood up on their heels and howled at the sky in mourning. there was no sound audible to human ears, just a deep, sickening throb that shook the air. wet and gleaming, the two remaining loxatl wound round each other and slithered away down the next street. their harness cannons were armed. the signals officer yelled. major landfreed ran over to him, ducking down below the parapet. shrapnel fluttered through the air from the nearby bombardment. orders were for the life company elements under land-freed to fall back to old hive. landfreed relayed the orders to his men. since noon, he had lost sixty troopers to the blood pact death-brigades. he was determined that those who remained would stay alive. his men started to move out: two squads, tight order. a hi-ex shell landed just the other side of the ruined wall and the blast shook the ground. tiles rattled down from the remains of the rafters. landfreed threw himself down hard. when he got up again, he was surrounded by smoke. he couldn't see any of his men. blinking, his eyes watering, he peered around, and found himself face to face with a black-robed figure that appeared out of nowhere. landfreed froze. terror locked up his limbs and his reflexes. he gazed up into a face materialising just twenty centimetres from his. it was bald and white, and utterly hairless. deep folds crisscrossed the skin, and made furrows around the smiling mouth and the dark eyes. a dried, brown residue soiled the eye-sockets.  it was the face of death, the bogey man that landfreed had been taught to fear. the haunter of the dark. skarwael slowly slid the tip of his boline up landfreed's tunic front, effortlessly slicing off every button in turn. the silver fastenings cascaded to the floor, bouncing and clattering. skarwael's boline stopped when it reached landfreed's bare throat. skarwael smiled. the smile made furrows deepen. predatory teeth, whiter than the pallid flesh that cased them, were distressingly revealed. move! landfreed yelled, finding his voice at last. and his laspistol. he opened fire on the monstrous shadow, but it had vanished. with a baffled gurgle, landis fell on his back, shot apart by his commander's blasts. boles and sanchez fired together, hosing the ruined brick wall in front of them with auto-fire. they had the shadow in their sights, but it moved like a black flicker up the wall, around their raking shots, and into the air. it turned for a moment in mid-flight, the ghastly black cape flowing out behind it like wings, then fell on sanchez. the life company trooper struggled and yelled and came apart as the near invisible shadow mauled him and then threw him aside. backing away, boles looked at landfreed. boles ran. behind him, landfreed turned to face the monster, raising his arm to shoot. but there was no pistol. no hand. just a cleanly severed wrist-stump. skarwael materialised in front of landfreed and impaled him on his boline. boles threw himself forward through the smoke and rubble. he could hear his commander dying back there. in the back of his terrified mind, he wondered one thing. what could make a death scream last so long? beltayn replied. first platoon was dug down in digre street, a commercial block off principal i in the guild slope, when gaunt rejoined them from the triage station. the pull back from the second line was a mess compared with the one the imperials had staged from the northern suburbs at first light. they hadn't held the second line for anything like as long as gaunt had hoped. the archenemy was ploughing deep furrows up through the dense guild slope and was already threatening the agridomes to the west. the defenders were meant to be withdrawing to the hive towers for the last stand, a tactical move overseen by biagi and lugo. landfreed had gone off line and his forces were in rout. kaldenbach's retreat was fundamentally impaired too � it seemed from the vox-log that he'd somehow lost several of his key subordinates, including lamm from the regiment civitas. even the ghosts were in disarray. gaunt tried and failed to coordinate with corbec and rawne their actions had been delayed by incidents that the vox-log gave no details of. the last contact from the beati had been a report of a hellish firefight in the low slope region. on digre street, it was getting bloody. first, fourth and twentieth platoons were heads down under heavy bombardment. the archenemy had drawn up a serious wedge of self-propelled guns into the skirts of the guild slope below their position, and now they were pasting the area. bright green-yellow geysers of fire erupted from the buildings around them, showering roof tiles and slabs into the air, and cascading rivulets of fire down off the intact rooftops. the air smelled of burned brick dust, so earthy and intense, it made the nostrils close. gaunt knew they were right on the edge now. they had a very narrow hope of getting the withdrawal to work. if they fumbled it � and fate wasn't with them � they wouldn't even live long enough to stage a last stand at the hives. if the enemy kept this pressure up, the imperial defence on herodor would be annihilated before it even reached the hives. gaunt ran across a burning street with beltayn, and joined with mkoll and ewler in the shelter of a half-tumbled wall. mkoll nodded. he says the bead's with him. beltayn nodded and turned back to his work. shells hammered down around them again. let's try and find a way out of this rat-trap. ewler? take the south side there. mkoll, with me. you too, bel. mkoll backtracked and rejoined gaunt and beltayn at the door of the empty room beltayn had opened. there was nothing to see, an entirely bare hab module. no carpet or rugs, no shade on the overhead lamp, walls stripped. a door to one side, closed. a console table drawn up in the centre of the floor, with a book on it. mkoll said. he had drawn his laspistol and sheathed his sword. mkoll glanced at beltayn, and beltayn shrugged.  gaunt walked to the small table oddly set in the centre of the room, and reached out to the book lying there it was old. so very old it was falling apart and dissolving into dust. he opened the cover and read the title page, knowing, with a sick feeling, what he would find there. it was another first edition of on the use of armies by marchese. he reached out towards it and the cover fell open, as if flipped by a strong wind. the pages fluttered and turned. gaunt stared down at the open book, and began to read: when i speak of a body in this way, i mean the body as a figure for an armed force. to the leader, that force becomes his body� he took a step back. he had been mindful of the things that had been shown to him, yet now they seemed to repeat with unsubtle reinforcement. had he missed so much? was he not being careful? the closed door nearby rattled in its frame, as if shaken by a strong wind. gaunt beckoned the two of them in to join him. do me this one service, my friends. gaunt opened the door. � elinor zaker, of the herodian commandery it was a chapel, old and rundown, buried in the green twilight of the wood. trailing ivy and fleece-flower clung to its walls. bright green lichens gnawed the chafstone. bemused, afraid, mkoll and beltayn followed gaunt around the partially collapsed wall, in through the old gate, and up the path to the door. the scent was back, that flower scent. it was so strong it made gaunt feel like sneezing. it was islumbine. gaunt pushed open the door and stepped into the cold gloom of the chapel. the interior was plain, but well-kept. at the end of the rows of hardwood pews , a taper burned at the imperial altar. gaunt walked down the aisle towards the graven image of the emperor. in the stained glass of the lancet windows, he saw the image of saint sabbat amongst the worthies. mkoll and beltayn hung back. mkoll asked. beltayn didn't answer. beltayn groaned quietly. mkoll blinked fast. myself, beltayn and my chief scout. so� this is herodor already? elinor zaker started. tell me! just tell me! if you can help me win, help me win! if not, why the feth did you ever draw me into this nonsense in the first place? sister? gaunt swallowed. she nodded to him. well, then. for the last time. the harm is in two parts. two dangers: one truly evil, one misunderstood. the latter holds the key. it's important you remember that, because you commissars are terribly trigger happy. that key is more important to you now than ever before. lastly, let your sharpest eye show you the truth. that's it. in darkness, the spread of carnage through the civitas was more visible. whole sections of the outer skirts and slopes were ablaze, and fires clustered and spread around the north faces of hive towers one and two as well. gaunt wasn't entirely sure when the city shield had failed, but it was long gone now, and winds from the north blew in across the civitas basin and fanned the firestorms. imperial troop units and support crews fled south up the streets of the high guild slope, some on foot, some in roaring carriers and trucks. the second line had entirely broken.  pressing hard at a trot, gaunt's three platoon force got as far as the atmosphere processor in fenzy yard, and there managed to hop a ride on a quartet of pdf troop carriers that raced them up the last third of the guild slope to the keep in the high town district that served as main barracks for the regiment civitas. the keep was largely intact. it had been hit by some long-range shelling, but its main structure, overlooking principal i, had survived. inside the assembly yard, hundreds of herodian troopers were massing, loading spare ordnance into waiting transports. gaunt jumped down from his ride and looked around as mkoll and ewler did a head count the night air was pungent with exhaust fumes, and ringing with the urgent shouts of men from all around. gaunt looked up. the high town district was the base area of the hives, and their immense forms rose up above him, giddyingly tall and reassuringly massive. they weren't towers, they were vertical cities, and they were of cyclopean construction. gaunt took a deep breath. gaunt asked. i've had him escorted down from the hives as you asked. biagi said. gaunt glanced at him. they came to a halt outside a security hatch, triple locked. two pdf sentries stood aside for them, and beat a hasty retreat when biagi dismissed them. the marshal fitted his authority key into the socket and the hatch whirred open. the chamber beyond was starkly lit by white phospha lamps. it was the keep's brig. meryn nodded. he looked angry. the tanith doctor had taken it upon himself to escort soric personally. a robed astropath and two bullish men in long grey leather coats stood by the cell door. the grey men, clutching power-goads, were officer-handlers from the life company's sanctioned psyker cadre. wire-grilled augmetic damper units were sutured into their ears and eye-sockets. dorden smiled sarcastically. dorden opened the cell hatch. soric was lying on the perforated metal cot, bathed in the hard light of the overhead phosphas. he had been badly beaten. biagi muttered, bending down to collect up some of the hundreds of crumpled scraps of blue paper that littered the cell floor. gaunt looked over his shoulder. the papers in the marshal's hands were covered in hasty, incomprehensible scrawl. biagi asked. the handler crossed to soric and searched him. soric moaned at the touch. the handler produced a brass shell case from soric's thigh pocket. you were desperate to tell me before! soric nodded slowly, and, with dorden's help, got himself up to a halfsitting position. soric had faded and slumped. biagi nodded. the handlers charged their goads. the sharp stink of ozone filled the little cell. dorden thumped the one-dose derma-ject into soric's arm and wiped the puncture with a swab loaded with rubbing alcohol. soric trembled, shivered and convulsed. soric raised his hand, and gaunt saw it was holding the brass message shell. i like a drink or two, you know that sir. i wondered� had i written it and forgotten gaunt asked. he put the message shell back into his pocket and then drew it out again. when he opened it there was a flimsy sheet of blue paper folded up inside. outside the simple cell, gaunt leaned heavily against the wall and wiped the rank sweat from his brow. i told you this war was symbolic! all that matters, all that your world is worth, is the life or death of the beati. biagi shrugged. gaunt nodded. dorden echoed. gaunt shuddered. domor ran across the yard to where the beati stood. milo was with her. she seemed to be staring at the sky. domor had to shout to make himself heard over the bombardment rippling through the nearby streets. the ground shook as a tank round demolished a commercial property not seventy metres away. sabbat shivered, as if the night air was cold. in truth, it was sweltering hot from the raging firestorms. milo asked. domor asked milo. milo shook his head. one last venture. out on the bare wastes of the great western obsidae, the night was a hard, dry sub-zero, cut by merciless winds from the outer zones. phospha lamps glowed and swung in the wind, coldly illuminating the row upon row of empty landers and transport ships. their mouth hatches were open, pointing south. there, distantly, the civitas lay, submerged in the murk and flash of war. the orange glow of the firestorms lit the low sky. thrusters whining and cycling hard a single lander, more massively armoured than the rest, came in low, sheeting up dust waves more fiercely than the desert winds. its locust escort turned and banked away. burners flared blue. hydraulic landing claws extended, and the battle transport settled like a giant mosquito. the ramps opened. light shone out crews of slave-carls spewed from the hatches, followed by a formal marching block of retinue in full armour. the retinue, five hundred strong, divided with parade ground precision, swung their weapons to shoulder in a perfectly synchronised movement, and formed two lines of honour guard. etrodai, his changeling blade skinned and hungry, strode down the ramp and he followed. he was dressed for war in gleaming beetle-black armour. his face was masked by his antlered helmet. the retinue murmured their moan of respect. enok innokenti, magister, warlord, chosen disciple of the archon, set foot on the dusty soil of herodor. he raised his arms in salutation. the retinue screamed his name. � ibram gaunt some of the men in corbec's platoon were getting vocal with their complaints, and corbec could half understand why. instructions had been simple. find the beati and get her back to old hive. and watch out in particular for the really bad things. of which there were nine, apparently. they weren't fighting anymore. they were sneaking. cloaked up, stealthy, using every shred of tanith woodcraft to edge through the splintered ruins of guild slope. they dodged advancing blood pact units, and hid while crimson tanks grumbled past, lamps blazing. there was the odd fire-fight or three, when circumstances demanded, but then it was strictly hit and run. they were working the shadows and staying alive. corbec was glad to have mkvenner back with him. he'd lost count of the blood pact throats ven had sliced that night as he led them at point. there was no getting away from the fact that they were all going to die here on herodor, one way or another. that was the way the odds were stacked, and not even varl or feygor would have given better. but by feth, they were going to make a good account of themselves. his camo-cloak pulled up around him like a hood, corbec scuttled forward at a signal from ven, passing orrin, cown, cole and irvinn in cover. he reached the street turn and used the shadows cast by a burning community hall to blend into the scenery. he raised a hand, made a signal of his own. veddekin, ponore, sillo, androby, and brown sprinted up on his heels and vanished into the shot-up print shop to his left. then surch and loell moved up smartly, lugging the .50 and its panniers of ammo. corbec scurried over to fresh cover. he was quiet for a big man. rerval and roskil covered him, and then slipped in behind him. the three of them were running, in file, down to the end of the block. a tank, or something similar, had flattened the building there and left nothing but ragged rockcrete sections, sprouting the broken strands of their internal metal reinforcement. corbec asked. corbec rose, and flashed a finger signal back. then he and ven were running forward again, with brown, cole, sillo and roskil behind them. the covered market had once had a glass roof, but the shockwaves from the shelling had brought it down. some wooden screens remained. the produce shops and trader barrows inside were all locked up and shuttered. corbec nodded, and turned to go back. then he stopped. he had smelt something. it was faint, very faint almost masked by the rich stink of smoke and burning fuel. something like cinnamon. he knew that smell, vividly. that particular reek. from hagia, the doctrinopolis � what was it now? four years ago? he'd never forget it. it was in his nightmares still. a moment in his life no amount of good nights' sleep could wear away. him and the poor boy yael. prisoners of the infardi. and that thing, that monster in human form. the one who'd butchered yael just to hear him scream. it couldn't be! that bastard was long dead� corbec breathed in again: cinnamon, sweat, decay. faint, but lingering. corbec advanced into the market lasrifle low and ready. he took care with every step. the floor was covered in chips of broken glass from the roof. on the edge of his nerves and as fine as any tanith scout corbec made no sound. he prowled in, checking from side to side. twice, he jumped at shadows and almost discharged his weapon. the smell grew stronger. corbec saw movement. low down, under a trader's barrow. he circled, switching his lasrifle to a single-handed grip as he fished out a lamp-pack. he edged round the cart, and saw there were two kids hiding between the wheels. little, hunched up kids. one of them was waving his hand beside his head, as if he was trying to fan the close air. corbec came around further, and clicked on the pack. he lit the kids up with a hard-light beam and they didn't flinch. he growled. something hit him from behind, a heavy, powerful mass that reeked of sweat and cinnamon. corbec lurched forward and crashed into the cart, overturning it. the weight was on him. he felt a knifing pain in his left shoulder. corbec yowled and smacked back with his elbow. the weight reduced, and he rolled, groping for his rifle. he blundered into the kids� though from his brief glimpse of them he knew they were not kids sin! eleven o'clock! cafrran shot at the front of the hab, though in truth he couldn't see the thing clearly anymore. dunik and feygor blasted with him, blindly following his lead. the ghosts had a particular revulsion for the loxatl kind. the thing reappeared, lower than caffran was estimating. little augmetic servo-limbs in its weapons harness clacked its blaster round and it fired. the first two flechette rounds hit the wall behind feygor making deep holes haloed by hundreds of lesser micro-impacts. the third atomised dunik's head and shoulders in a bloody vapour. caffran and feygor threw themselves flat. leyr, cut along the hand and arm by stray barbs, yelped and stumbled. they dragged him into cover. the loxatl's cannon repeated its distinctive rattling cough and hailed splinters along the street wall at head height. someone screamed. rawne was on his hands and knees behind an abandoned ground car and glanced up in horror at the huge, ragged holes the xenos weapon was punching in the wall above him. each impact was actually a thousand razor barbs hitting simultaneously. fifty metres back, kolea and criid heard his signal and glanced at each other. the whining cough of loxatl cannons had a particular resonance for them both. ouranberg. criid in trouble. kolea effectively giving up his life to save her. she wailed. she flinched. her face was sticky and wet. it was kenfeld's blood. his mangled body had been thrown five metres backwards, as hard and fast as if a speeding truck had run into it. criid ducked into cover and started to recell her weapon with shaking hands. she heard las-shots, the answering cough of the blaster, and then footsteps running. gol kolea threw himself down beside her. she asked. sarge? �message written in soric's hand closure required the gene-print of the first officiary. leger was frightened, and had to be talked through the procedure, but biagi was patient. leger mumbled. cannon teams guarded the slopes of the hive gate below. rolling gunfire was hitting old hive's base level precincts. waves of archenemy units, most of them motorised, stormed in towards the towers at ground level, and the air assault had redoubled. it was close to dawn.  a string of shot-up carriers rumbled in under the gate, and thundered down the slip road into old hive's vast entry halls. as soon as they stopped, they popped their hatches. domor's platoon scrambled out. gaunt paused and consulted his data-slate. they were all inside old hive now, all the surviving regiment civitas, the pdf and life company. all that could be expected anyway. on his own list, the tanith list, one unit was missing. corbec gazed at gaunt. biagi yelled. leger placed his hand on the gene-reader plate and declared his authority. the massive blast shutters of the old hive gates clanged into place. nineteenth platoon were about five hundred metres from old hive's north entrance when they saw the gates close. skerral stopped in his tracks, and pulled the men up. half his unit were dead. he ejected a cell from his lasrifle and slammed in a new one. the remnants of nineteenth lasted seventeen minutes from the time the gates closed. they accounted for one hundred and eighty-nine enemy casualties. no one witnessed their heroism. old hive, as massive as it was, throbbed under the attack hailing at it from outside. many upper levels were on fire. the massed forces of the magister slammed against the outer walls again and again. word came through that hive tower two had been taken. innokenti himself was there, receiving civilian sacrifices. the main gates of old hive fell at mid morning. the death brigades flowed in, fighting street by street and compartment by compartment to overrun the tower. gaunt walked down the staircase into the holy balneary in the base of old hive. the thousands of electrocandles flickered and twinkled. most of the notables were already assembled below at the poolside. lugo, biagi, leger, kilosh and the ayatanis, kaldenbach, the chief astropaths, the senior ecclesiarchs. the service had been the beati's idea. a final blessing for her loyal forces before the end came. gaunt felt resigned to it all. they were just hours from death now. ferocious hive fighting tore through the outer levels of the tower. parts of the external superstructure were beginning to collapse under intense bombardment. even so, he'd allowed just a bare minimum of ghosts to attend. fighting the enemy took priority over any sacred blessing. the only ghosts who he had permitted to accompany him marched in a double file down the steps behind him. the tanith flame troopers. they carried their tanks and hoses proudly. biagi had personally requested their attendance he wanted to honour them, and recognise the vital role they'd played, despite the ancient civitas laws. gaunt ushered them onto the poolside, and they formed up in neat ranks. the bead, encased in her golden armour, stood thigh deep in the pool, proclaiming the devotional of kiodrus. milo waited nearby, with the temple adepts, at the top of the bath steps. sabbat's voice echoed through the warm, damp air. she praised the forces that had drawn about her on herodor, and mentioned the officers and unit commanders by name. seventy per cent of the names she spoke were the names of dead men. gaunt, standing to attention with his troopers, started to blank out her words. the air was warm, and he was filled with a sense of mortality. this was all just fine talk. battle awaited them, above in the hive, and it would be their last. gaunt found his attention drifting to a pulse of bubbles that rippled the water at the far end of the balneary pool from sabbat. some kind of vent. more bubbles. karess erupted from the balneary pool. his hull was rank and filthy from his passage through the deep places under the civitas. his weapon limbs swung up and started to fire. a heavy bolter cannon and a plasma gun. horrified panic seized the congregation in the holy balneary. priests and soldiers scattered in all directions, some slipping on the wet stone. no one quite believed a chaos dreadnought could suddenly reveal itself like this. karess strode forward through the swirling water of the pool, weaponlimbs firing, broadcasting obscenities. basalt chips spattered out of the pool side. bolter rounds slaughtered five temple adepts and three life company officers. kilosh was incinerated by a plasma beam. kaldenbach fell over, blood pouring from a gut-wound. karess advanced onto the pool steps, emerging more fully from the water. he traversed his hull to target the left side of the bathhouse. his heavy bolter slammed and roared and the side wall was plastered with blood and exploded tissue. first officiary leger and the civitas master astropath both ceased to exist in that salvo. sabbat stumbled up the pool steps and milo started to drag her towards the cover of one of the balneary's massive stone columns. biagi ran to help him, firing his service pistol into the pool. a bolt round hit him in the chest and threw his ruptured corpse back across the chamber, knocking several people over as they tried to flee. one of them was lord general lugo. shrieking, lugo tore himself clear of the fallen bodies and rose. the killing machine was now nearly at the top of the pool steps, setting its first massive claw-foot on the poolside proper. milo had got the beati behind a pillar and just about everybody else still alive in the room was in cover. karess' sensor augmetics dialled and clicked as it swung its bulk around, hunting for targets. hunting for the target. it saw lugo, eyes wild in terror as he staggered backwards. karess emitted another stream of strangled obscenity and aimed his bolter. it didn't fire a blow had rocked it spitting filth, it swung its massive iron torso round to locate the source and felt another strike at its flank. gaunt drew back the power blade of heironymo sondar and struck again. the war machine was monumental and vastly powerful, but it was slow and cumbersome. it fired, but gaunt was behind it, splashing through the shallow water at the top of the steps. he lashed out with the sword again and split a deep gash right through karess' rear hull casing. karess uttered an electronic squeal, and rocked around with a grinding dank of gears. the edge of his plasma cannon smashed into gaunt and hurled him back into the pool. the dreadnought turned back, screaming blasphemies, and located the pillar where the beati was sheltering. clutching his terrible belly wound, kaldenbach struggled to his knees. he was only a few metres from the killer. gasping with pain, he pulled a stick grenade and rolled it across the flagstones. it came to rest between karess' massive foot-claws. the blast blew the upper part of the pool steps into fragments. it barely damaged karess, but it pitched him off his feet the brute machine crashed backwards into the pool, sheeting water up into the air. five tanith flame-troops ran to the edge of the pool and hosed the water with liquid fire. in the enclosed stone chamber, the heat was immense. steam gouted up. they continued to hose� brostin, lubba, dremmond, lyse, neskon� churning the water into a scalding, bubbling froth. karess' armoured hull was proof against just about anything, but gaunt's sword had sliced a hole in it. boiling water squirted in, into his casing, broiling the living vestige inside. karess sank, his hull lights dimmed, and went out. brostin and his brethren ceased fire and raised their burner-guns. the air was sweltering hot and thick with steam and smoke. blood coated almost every surface of the ancient chamber. at terrible cost, the last of the nine had been stopped. in his cell, much further up in old hive, agun soric felt a sudden rush of relief. he lay back on his cot, his heart pounding. then he felt something twitch in the pocket of his jacket. gaunt laughed sadly. but the crusade would have been lost. macaroth has overstretched himself. innokenti's flank attack now bites deep into the khan group. the warmaster and i would have achieved victory on morlond, only to see the forces behind us destroyed by counter-attack. to us and the archenemy. innokenti could not ignore me. i intended to announce it at the ceremony in the balneary, but we were interrupted. gaunt sighed, astonished. with overwhelming forces, the monster innokenti has crushed us physically, but he cannot crush our spirit. our sacrifice has ensured great victory. do not die in fear and hiding. make the price of your lives dear. the emperor of mankind has room for all in his imperial army. please! you have to let me out! i need to warn her! no one answered. at this late hour, with the city falling, there was in truth no one left on duty in the detention block to hear him anyway. he screamed and hammered again, tears coursing down his craggy face. the open shell case, and its fold of blue paper, lay on the cot behind him. �message written in soric's hand for the first hour or so of the fight, anton alphant had used a pistol looted from an enemy corpse, but then they'd found a pdf carrier abandoned at the side of one of the approach streets to hive tower one, and they'd recovered half a dozen lasrifles from it. it had a wire stock instead of the pressed metal one he'd been used to in his guard days, but apart from that it was shockingly familiar. night, wild with firestorms and a monumental roar of war, had engulfed the civitas, and alphant found himself caught up in the bloodiest fighting he had ever known, his former days of soldiering included. he did his best to try and make sense of the street combat and to guide the pilgrim forces with him through. there was no formal structure to the pilgrim army. it was essentially a gigantic mob. but the beati had come to them in the agridomes, drawing men like alphant out of the crowd, and telling the pilgrims to look to them for leadership. most already did. sabbat had unerringly picked on those people who had some military background, or on men or women who had already become the natural leaders of pilgrim bands. they had no plan as such� except to throw themselves against the enemy. alphant tried to rally his part of the zealot tide towards old hive, where the beati was said to be under siege. her life was all that mattered. etrodai had never known him so deranged by rage. the magister's fury was so great that etrodai even feared for his own life. howling, a blinding sphere of crackling corposant around him, enok innokenti drove the retinue and three of the blood pact's veteran death-brigades into the bowels of old hive, through hallways and gallery levels shattered by fighting and littered with the bodies of the slain. hatchway by hatchway, hall by hall, they ground into the failing defences of the tower city. at the forefront, etrodai swept his changeling blade through pdf troopers, imperial guardsmen and frantic civilian fighters. over a hundred thousand blood pact soldiers, along with armoured vehicles, were now inside old hive, spreading like wildfire through the lower levels. hundreds of thousands more massed outside in the ruins of the high town as the city burned behind them. there were reports of counter attacks to the flank, but etrodai was sure they couldn't be right there were no other imperial forces here on herodor to stage such attacks. the saint's defiant broadcast had driven the magister to his pitch of rage. he wanted her. he would kill her himself. her life was all that mattered. just before midnight, a death brigade managed to mine two central power generators in the sub-ground levels of old hive, mainly in an effort to shut off the continued broadcasts of the saint's message, which so maddened their master. the blast tore out two hive levels, and caused a great internal collapse that killed thousands. power was cut on eighteen city levels above where the slaughter raged in the lower levels, the halls and hive thoroughfares became like infernal caves, lit only by flames and the flash of weapons fire. fires burned out of control with the suppression systems cut, and smoke collected in the uncirculating airspaces. innokenti and his vanguard swept through it all, lit by the glittering fires of his psyker malice and by the lethal ribbons of energy that were his bloodrage made manifest. the invaders surged in behind them. in the cell block high above, darkness fell. soric hoarse and exhausted, waited for the secondary systems to kick in, but none did. he wedged his hands against the cell door and started to pull at it. if the power had comprehensively failed, then the mag-locks would have failed too. the door refused to budge. he tried again, snorting with effort, and at last the steel plate began to slide back in its groove. soric pulled until he could get his bloodied fingers into the gap and grab more purchase. he slid the cell door open and staggered out. the cell dock was dark. stumbling and groping, he made his way out and down into an assembly yard. the main gates of the detention unit were open. outside, the hive thoroughfare was pitch black and abandoned. he felt a rumbling from below, distant. the air was stale and smelled of smoke. through the big riser vents in the thoroughfare he could hear noises echoing upwards through the vast structure of the hive. sounds of carnage and destruction, sounds of death. soric limped down the empty hallway in search of a stairwell. the magister's arrival on the great concourse, a vast public space on the ninth level of old hive, was announced by the stalk-tanks that came blasting up the three great ashlar staircases that ascended from the transit terminals and ornamental gardens below. such was the scale of the staircases, the war machines were able to climb five or six abreast, with retinue and blood pact troopers rushing on foot in their wake, firing up at the imperials dug in around the ornate basalt rails of the concourse level. the vast space was three hive levels deep, and the massive glass pendant lights that hung from the arched roof had been dark since the power failure. great windows thirty metres high overlooked the staircases and lit the concourse with the glow of the burning city outside. major udol, now ranking commander of the planetary forces, had assembled the last of his armour on the concourse, and their guns met the stalk-tanks as they came up from the steps. shell blasts tore across the pavements, hurling stone slabs and men into the air. pulse-lasers spat their pumping streams through the hellish gloom, ripping open the fronts of the buildings lining the concourse and shattering the huge obsidian sculptures that hung down from the roof. class images of the aquila and other imperial crests crashed down in avalanches of glass shards, exploding into fragments like falling ice. the magister's forces surged up onto the concourse. gaunt had drawn up half the tanith regiment and the last of the life company behind the armour for this stand. all remaining forces were occupied on other levels, meeting other invasions, but this, gaunt knew, was the key. she had told him so. she had felt the wrath of innokenti approaching. udol's armour rolled back slowly across the pavements, crunching over the vast heaps of broken glass, tiling as it went. they took heavy losses, but not a single stalk-tank made it more than twenty metres from the head of the steps.  udol's gentle retreat was designed to lure a good portion of enemy infantry up onto the concourse, where there was no cover. hundreds of blood part and retinue troopers were cut down or blown apart. then the archenemy rallied, and the firefight began in earnest. still the imperials punished them. gaunt ordered. his men had the full advantage of the buildings on either side of the pavements, and the still advancing enemy had nothing but open space. gaunt saw a ripple of light at the top of the steps. unearthly, malevolent light, crackling like lightning. in horror, he realised that the beati and the life company had broken cover formation and were charging onto the concourse towards it. the beati herself was lit up in a halo of green fire. she yelled. the luminous aquila around her flared to three times its size, snapping and beating at the high roof. the sound of her voice was so clear, so loud, it blew out the great windows of the concourse in a vast blizzard of glass. to a man, every archenemy warrior on herodor shrieked. where he had been hard-pressed just a minute before, corbec now found himself facing an empty hallway. weary and nervous, he edged his forces forward, dealing through to the western gate of the hive. something had most definitely happened. rerval shook his head. a huge and devastating rush of psyk-noise had just burned out all the comm channels and fused every vox-set in the hive area. mkvenner nodded. he rounded up the ghosts and pdf in the immediate area and put them to work building barricades with the debris in the hall. haller ran up as the work began. corbec looked round. mkoll was approaching now. some of his squad came up behind, battered and bleeding like the rest of them, escorting a figure. it was soric. soric swallowed. milo put his arm around the beati's shoulders and led her across the concourse. she was shaking with exhaustion, and deep slashes from innokenti's blade were bleeding freely. gaunt turned to the men around him. gaunt looked and realised the old sniper was right. dorden, daur, nessa, milo and derin had all been part of corbec's inspired mission on the shrineworld. apart from corbec himself, the only ones missing were the ones no longer alive. using lamp packs to light their way, and moving slowly, the escort left the great concourse and headed down the connective hallways towards the main stairwell. they walked through abandoned hive streets littered by warfare and looting. terrified and stunned civilians huddled in the ruins and watched them pass by, bowing at the sight of the saint. edgy, gaunt walked with them, desperate for the vox to come back so he could get a picture of the situation. he'd have to trust rawne and udol to get things solid without him. they were clearing another hallway, close to the access shafts, when gaunt saw a flash of torchlight and heard a voice calling his name. panting hard, corbec ran up, followed by soric. gaunt asked. gaunt yelled and raised his lamp to read the scrap as dorden and the honour guard hurried the beati towards shelter. nessa and larkin immediately raised their long-lases and started to scan for trouble through their scopes. he swung round. everyone dropped. another two shots zapped at them. one hit derin in the shoulder and threw him off his feet. larkin moaned, training his weapon. two more shots whined in. nessa tried a return, and banged a hot-shot into the darkness. the killer's reply, a semi-auto flurry, hit daur in the hip and slammed dorden over against the wall. fury boiled through ibram gaunt. soric's talent had not only identified the killer imprinted by sin's psykers, it had exposed him for all he was. soric had seen into the hateful mind of a stone killer and revealed all his crimes. lijah cuu. murderer. rapist. killer of bragg. killer of sehra muril. a las-round hit gaunt in the back and threw him hard onto his face. he felt the hot rush of blood leaking out of him. he tried to turn. the straight silver came down to gaunt's throat. the hot-shot was so loud the noise of it rolled up and back down the hallway. gaunt felt cuu's deadweight slam down across him. he struggled out from under cuu's body. larkin bent down and dragged him up. gaunt swayed. the wound in his back was agonising. she smiled and nodded. a power-goad lashed him into silence. the black robed figure nodded. viktor hark took hold of the data-slate with his newly implanted augmetic limb and studied it. he put his signature on the plate with the stylus and handed the slate back to the inquisitor. hark asked. he yelled, and the handlers goaded the shackled soric up the ramp. hark could hear soric sobbing. he turned away, shutting it out. a brass message shell sat on the deck grille at his feet. hark leaned down and picked it up in his augmetic hand. he opened it and knocked out the paper. two words were written on the blue scrap. help me. hark turned back and watched as the shuttle lifted off and swung up and away into the sky. the saw was shrilling. the lovely whine of good wood splitting. the air was thick with aromatic dust. colm corbec walked into the little woodshop off guild slope and watched for a while as the old man � what was his name again� wyze? � worked the wood. business had been brisk. feth, yes! coffins for the departed. god-emperor, that was supply and demand! corbec stepped into the pungent, dry air of the woodshop, and ran his hand down a length of mature timber. not nalwood, but good. this wyze he was all on his own, without any assistance. not the way corbec's father would have run it. he needed a hand. corbec rolled up his sleeves. he knew this work. he liked it. he'd stay awhile and help out. nalwood. brother.
