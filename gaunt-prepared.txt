A WARHAMMER 40,000 NOVEL GHOSTMAKER Gaunts Ghosts - 02 IT IS THE 41st millennium. For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.  YET EVEN IN his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse.  TO BE A man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruellest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.  Inheriting command of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade force from the late and lauded Warmaster Slaydo, Warmaster Macaroth renewed the Imperial offensive to liberate the Sabbat Worlds, a cluster of nearly one hundred inhabited  systems along the edge of the Segmentum Pacificus. Many legendary actions distinguished that twenty year campaign, and many legends were made: the last stand of the Latarii Gundogs at Lamicia, the Iron Snakes victories at Presarius, Ambold Eleven and Fornax Aleph, and the dogged prosecution of the enemy by the so-called Ghosts of Tanith on Canemara, Spurtis Elipse, Menezoid Epsilon and Monthax. Of these, perhaps Monthax presents the most intriguing question for Imperial historians. Ostensibly a head-on confrontation with the forces of Chaos, this action is clouded in mystery and the details are still sequestered in the archives of Imperial High Command. Only speculation remains as to what truly occurred on the tangled shores of that hideous battle site.  - from A History of the Later Imperial Crusades  It was summer here, apparently. Intermittent but heavy rain sluiced the Imperium lines from a sky wrinkled with grey cloud cover. Barbed, twisted root-plants with florid, heavy leaves groped their way out of every inch of muddy land and poked from the shimmering waterbeds too. As land went, most of it had gone. Lagoons and long pools of sheened water forked through the groves of undergrowth, home to billowing micro-flies and unseen, chirruping insects.  There was a smell in the air, a smell like rank sweat. The smell didnt surprise Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt. What did surprise him was that it wasnt coming from his men. It was exuding from the water, the plants, the mud. Monthax reeked of corruption and rot. There was no digging-in on Monthax. Trenches were raised abutments of imported flak-board and locally cut timber. Levees and sand-bagged walls had been dug out and raised by the Ghosts. For three days, since the dropships landed them, there had been no other sound except the squelch of entrenching tools as work parties filled plastic sacks. No other sound except the chirrup of a billion insects. Seeping sweat into his freshly-donned tunic from the moment he had it on, Gaunt emerged from his command shed, a three chamber modular habitat staked up on girder poles out of the soupy water. He put his commissars cap squarely on his head, knowing full well that it would make sweat run into his eyes. He wore high boots, breeches and a tunic shirt, carrying his weatherproof overcoat over his shoulders. It was too hot to wear it, too wet to go without.  Ibram Gaunt stepped down off the shed steps and his feet settled in satin-skinned water twenty centimetres deep. He paused. The oily ripples ebbed away and he looked down at himself. A reflected Gaunt lay horizontal in the rank water at his feet. Tall, lean, with a sculpted, high-cheeked face that ironically mocked his name. He looked away, up, through the fleshy leaves of the thickets and the coiled low cover of the plant growth. On the horizon, partly screened by sweating mist, firepower roared back and forth as Imperial gunnery duelled with the heavy artillery of Chaos.  He strode forward through the slushy water, up through the dry land of an islet thick with tendrils and overhanging flowers, and along a duck-board walkway towards the lines.  Behind a long, meandering, S-shaped embankment levee three kilometres long, the Tanith First-and-Only stood ready. They had raised this dyke themselves, armouring it with rapidly decaying planks of flak-board. Artificial mounds had been dug behind the defence to keep ammo piles out of the water. His men stood ready in fire-teams, fifteen hundred strong, dressed in the black capes and dull body-armour uniform that was their signature. Some stood at eyeholes in the dyke, guns fixed. Others manned heavy weapon nests. Others stood and smoked and chatted and speculated. All stood in at least fifteen centimetres of murky slime. The bivouacs, also raised on girder legs out of the swamp, were set back from the dyke line by about thirty metres. Little sanctuaries of dryness lifted out of the ooze. Gaunt wandered along the dyke to the first group of men, who were digging up a footstep by the dyke wall from mud spaded out of the waterline.  Whooping birds swung overhead, large-winged and stark-white with folded, gangly pink legs. The insects chirruped.  Sweat made half moons in the underarms of his tunic in less than a dozen paces. Flies stung him. All thoughts of future glory, of the bitter action to come, left Ibram Gaunts mind. Instead, the echoes came. The memories. Gaunt cursed quietly, wiped his brow. It was days like this, in the slow, loaded hours while they waited for combat, that the memories flooded back at their most intense. Of the past, of lost comrades and missed friends, of glories and defeats long gone, of ends.  And of beginnings ONE GHOSTMAKER Fire, like a flower. Blossoming. Pale, greenish fire, scuttling like it was alive. Eating the world, the whole world  Opening his eyes, Ibram Gaunt, Imperial Commissar, gazed into his own lean, pale face. Trees, as dark green as an ocean at night, rushed past behind his eyes.  Were making the final approach now, sir. Gaunt looked round, away from his reflection in the small, thick port of the orbital cutter, and saw his adjutant, Sym. Sym was an efficient man of middle years, his slightly puffy flesh marked across the throat and cheek by a livid, ancient burn.  I said, were making the final approach, Sym repeated. I heard you, Gaunt nodded gently. Remind me again of the schedule. Sym sat back in his padded leather G-chair and perused a data-slate. Official greeting ceremony. Formal introductions to the Elector of Tanith and the government assembly. Review of the Founding regiments. And a formal dinner tonight.  Gaunts gaze drifted back to the vast forests that flew by under the window. He hated the trappings of pomp and protocol, and Sym knew it.  Tomorrow, sir, the transfer shifts begin. Well have all the regiments aboard and ready to embark before the end of the week, the man said, trying to put a more positive spin on things.  Gaunt didnt look round but said, See if you can get the transfers to begin directly after the review. Why waste the rest of today and tonight?  Sym nodded, thoughtful. That should be possible. A soft chime signalled imminent landfall, and they both felt the sudden pull of deceleration g-forces. The other passengers in the crafts long cabin: an astropath, silent in his robes, and officials of the Adeptus Ministorum and the Departmento Munitorium, began to buckle their harnesses and settle back for landing. Sym found himself looking out of the port, watching the endless forests that so intrigued Gaunt.  Strange place this, this Tanith. So they say. He rubbed his chin. They say the forests move. Change. The trees apparently uhm shift. According to the pilot, you can get lost in the woods in a matter of minutes. Syms voice dropped to a whisper. They say its a touch of Chaos! Can you believe that? They say Tanith has a touch of Chaos, being this close to the Edge, you see.  Gaunt did not reply. The spires and towers of Tanith Magna rose to meet the small barbed shape of the cutter. The city, set here amid the endless oceans of evergreen trees, looked from the air like a complex circle of standing stones, dark grey slabs raised in a clearing in defiance of the forest around. Banners and brazier smoke fluttered from the higher fortress walls, and outside the city perimeter, Gaunt could see a vast plain cut from the forest. Row upon row of tents stood there, thousands of them, each with its own cookfire. The Founding Fields. Beyond the tent-town, the huge black shadows of the bulk transports, whale-mouths and belly ramps open, squatting in fire-blackened craters of earth, ready to eat up the men and the machines of the new regiments of Tanith.  His regiments, he reminded himself, the first Imperial Guard regiments to be founded on this enigmatic, sparsely populated frontier world.  For eight years, Gaunt had served as political officer with the Hyrkan 8th, a brave regiment that he had been with from its founding on the windy hills of Hyrkan to the ferocious victory of Balhaut. But so many had fallen, and another founding would fill familiar uniforms with unfamiliar faces. It was time to move on, and Gaunt had felt grateful to be reassigned. His seniority, his experience his very notoriety made him an ideal choice to whip the virgin units of Tanith into shape. Part of him, a young, eager but small part deep inside, relished the prospect of building a fresh name for the Guards roll of honour. But the rest of him was dull, set rigid, empty. More than anything, he felt he was simply going through the motions.  He had felt that way since Slaydos death. The old commander would have wanted him here, wanted him to carry on to glory after all, wasnt that why hed made his gift? Promoting him there, on the firefields of Balhaut, to colonel-commissar making him one of the few political officers in the Guard capable of commanding a regiment.  Such trust, such faith. But Gaunt was so tired. It didnt seem much like a reward now. The cutter dipped. Great brass shutters atop one of the citys largest towers hinged open like an orchids petals to receive it.  On the Founding Fields, the men looked up as the approaching cutter purred overhead, banked against the slow cloud and settled like a beetle over the city wall towards the landing tower.  Someone important, noted Larkin, squinting up at the sky. He spat on the wirecloth in his hand and resumed polishing his webbing buckles.  Just more traffic. More pompous off-worlders. Rawne lay back and turned his face to the sun. Corbec, stood by his tent, shielded his eyes against the glare and nodded. I think Larkins right. Someone important. There was a big Guard crest on the flank of that flier. Someone come for the Founding Review. Maybe this colonel-commissar himself.  He dropped his gaze and looked about. On either side of him, the rows of three-man tents stretched away in ordered files, and guardsmen in brand new uniforms sat around, cleaning kit, stripping guns, eating, dicing, smoking, sleeping. Six thousand men, all told, mostly infantry but some artillery and armoured crews, three whole regiments and men of Tanith all.  Corbec sat down by his own cook stove and rubbed his hands. His new, black-cloth uniform chafed at the edges of his big frame. It would be the very devil to wear in. He looked across at his tent-mates, Larkin and Rawne. Larkin was a slender, whipcord man with a dagger face. Like all the Tanith, he was pale skinned and black haired. Larkin had dangerous eyes like blue fire, a left ear studded with three silver hoops, and a blue spiral-wyrm tattoo on his right cheek. Corbec had known him for a good while: they had served together in the same unit of the Tanith Magna militia before the Founding. He knew Larkins strengths  a marksmans eyes and a brave heart  and his weaknesses  an unstable character, easily rattled.  Rawne he did not know as well. Rawne was a handsome devil, his clean, sleek features decorated by a tattoo starburst over one eye. He had been a junior officer in the militia of Tanith Attica, or one of the other southern cities, but he didnt talk about it much. Corbec had a bad feeling there was a murderous, ruthless streak under Rawnes oily charm.  Bragg  huge, hulking, genial Bragg  shuffled over from his tent, a flask of hot sacra in his hands. Need warming up? he asked and Corbec nodded a smile to the giant man. Bragg poured four cups, and passed one to Larkin, who barely looked up but muttered thanks, and one to Rawne, who said nothing as he knocked it back.  You reckon that was our commissar, then? Bragg said at last, asking the question Corbec knew he had been dying to get out since overhearing Corbecs remark.  Corbec sipped and nodded. Gaunt? Yeah, most like. I heard stuff, from the Munitorium blokes at the transports. They say hes hard as nails. Got medals too. A real killer, they say.  Rawne sniffed. Why cant we be led by our own, is what I want to know. A good militia commanders all we need.  I could offer, Corbec joked softly. He said a good one, dog! Larkin snapped, returning to his obsessive polishing. Corbec winked across at Bragg and they sipped some more. It seems funny to be going though, dunnit? Bragg said after a spell. I mean, for good. Might never be coming back.  Most like, Corbec said. Thats the job. To serve the Emperor in his wars, over the stars and far away. Best get used to the idea.  Eyes up! Forgal called from a tent nearby. Here comes big Garth with a face on! They looked around. Major Garth, their unit commander, was thumping down the tent line issuing quick orders left and right. Garth was a barrel-chested buttress of a man, whose sloping bulk and heavy, lined features seemed to suggest that gravity pulled on him harder than most. He drew up to them. Pack it up, boys. Time to ship, he said. Corbec raised an eyebrow. I thought that was tomorrow? he began. So did I, so did Colonel Forth, so did the Departmento Munitorium, but it looks like our new colonel-commissar is an impatient man, so he wants us to start lifting to the troop-ships right after the Review. Garth passed on, shouting more instructions. Well, Colm Corbec said to no one in particular, I guess this is where it all starts. Gaunts head ached. He wasnt sure if it was the interminable introductions to Tanith dignitaries and politicos, the endless small talk, the achingly slow review of the troops out on the marshalling yard in front of the Tanith Assembly, or simply the bloody pipe music that seemed to be playing in every damn chamber, street and courtyard of the city that he walked into.  And the troops hadnt been that impressive either. Pale, dark-haired, undernourished-looking somehow, haggard in plain black fatigues, each with a piebald camo-cloak swept over the shoulder opposite the one to which their lasgun was slung. Not to mention the damn earstuds and hoops, the facial tattoos, the unkempt hair, the lilting, sing-song accents. The glorious 1st, 2nd and 3rd of Tanith, the new regiments; a scrawny, scruffy mob of soft-voiced woodsmen indeed, and nothing to write home about.  The Elector of Tanith, the local planetary lord, himself sporting a cheek tattoo of a snake, had assured Gaunt of the fighting mettle of the Tanith militia.  They are resolute and cunning, the Elector had said as they stood on the terrace overlooking the massed ranks. Tanith breeds indefatigable men. And our particular strengths are in scouting and stealth. As you might expect on a world whose moving forests blur the topography with bewildering speed, the Tanith have an unerring sense of place and direction. They do not get lost. They perceive what others miss. In the main, I need fighters, not guides, Gaunt had said, trying not to sound too snide. The Elector had merely smiled. Oh, we fight too. And now for the first time we are honoured to be adding our fighting spirit to that of the Imperium. The regiments of Tanith will serve you well, colonel-commissar. Gaunt had nodded politely. Now Gaunt sat in private in an anteroom of the Assembly. Hed slung his greatcoat and his cap on a hardwood chest nearby and Sym had laid out his dress jacket for the dinner that would commence in thirty minutes. If only he could rid himself of his headache and of the bad taste in his throat that he had landed a weak command.  And the music! The damn pipe music, invading his head even here in the private rooms! He got to his feet and strode to the sloping windows. Out beyond the cityscape and the Founding Fields, orange fire thumped into the twilight as the heavy transports departed and returned, ferrying the regimental components to the vast troop carriers in high orbit.  That music still! Gaunt walked to a set of dark green velvet drapes and swept them aside. The music stopped. The boy with the small set of pipes looked at his raging eyes in astonishment.  What are you doing? Gaunt asked, as threatening as a drawn knife. Playing, sir, the boy said. He was about seventeen, not yet a man, but tall and well-made. His face, a blue fish tattoo over the left eye, was strong and handsome. His be-ringed fingers clutched a Tanith pipe, a spidery clutch of reeds attached to a small bellows bag that was rhythmically squeezed under the arm.  Was this your idea? Gaunt asked. The boy shook his head. Its tradition. For every visitor, the pipes of Tanith will play, wherever they go, to lead them back through the forest safely.  Im not in the forest, so shut up! Gaunt paused. He turned back to the boy. I respect the traditions and customs of the Tanith, but I I have a headache.  Ill stop then, the boy said. I  Ill wait outside. The Elector told me to attend on you and pipe you while you were here. Ill be outside if you need me. Gaunt nodded. On his way out of the door, the boy collided with Sym, who was on the way in. I know, I know Gaunt began. If I dont hurry, Ill be late for the dinner and  What? Sym? What is it? The look on Syms face immediately told Gaunt that something was very, very wrong. Gaunt gathered his senior staff in a small, wood-panelled lobby off the main banqueting hall. Most were dressed for the formal function, stiff in gilt collars and cuffs. Junior Munitorium staff watched the doors, politely barring the entry of any Tanith dignitaries.  I dont understand! said a senior Departmento Munitorium staffer. The nearest edge of the warzone is meant to be eighty days from here! How can this be? Gaunt was pacing, reviewing a data-slate with fierce intensity. We broke them at Balhaut, but they splintered. Deep intelligence and the scout squadrons suggested they were running scared, but it was always possible that some of their larger components would scatter inwards, looping towards us, rather than running for the back end of the Sabbat Worlds and away.  Gaunt wheeled on them and cursed out loud. In the name of Solan! On his damn deathbed, Slaydo was quite precise about this! Picket fleets were meant to guard all the warpgates towards territories like Tanith, particularly  whenwere still at founding and vulnerable like this! What does Macaroth think hes playing at? Sym looked up from a flatplan-chart he had unfurled on a desk. The lord high militant commander has deployed most of the Crusade Forces in the liberation push. It is clear he is intent on pressing the advantage won by his predecessor.  Balhaut was a significant win began one of the Ecclesiarchy. It will only stay a victory if we police the won territories correctly. Macaroth has broken the new front by racing to pursue the foe. And thats let the foe through, in behind our main army. Its text book stupidity! The enemy may even have lured us on!  It leaves us wide open, another Ecclesiarch agreed flatly. Gaunt nodded. An hour ago, our ships in orbit detected a massive enemy armada coming in-system. It is no exaggeration to say that Tanith has just hours of life left to it.  We could fight someone ventured bravely. We have just three regiments. Untried, unproven. We have no defensive position and no prepared emplacements. Half of our force is already stowed in the troop carriers upstairs and the other half is penned in transit. We couldnt turn them around and get them unlimbered and dug in in under two full days. Either way, they are cannon fodder. What do we do? Sym asked. Some of the others nodded as if urging the same question. Our astropaths must send word immediately to the main crusade command, to Macaroth, and tell him of the insurgency. If nothing else, they need to turn and guard their flank and back. The rest of you: the carrier ships will leave orbit in one hour or at the point of attack, whichever comes first. Get as much of the remaining disembarked men and equipment aboard as you can before then. Whatevers left gets left behind. Were abandoning Tanith? a Munitorium aide said, disbelief in his thin voice. Tanith is already dead. We can die with it, or we can salvage as many fighting men as we can and re-deploy them  somewhere they will actually do some good. In the Emperors name. They all looked at him, incredulous, the enormity of his decision sinking in. DO IT! he bawled. The night sky above Tanith Magna caught fire and fell on the world. The orbital bombardment blew white-hot holes out of the ancient forests, melted the high walls, splintered the towers, and shattered the paved yards.  Dark shapes moved through the smoke-choked corridors of the Assembly, dark shapes that gibbered and hissed, clutching chattering, whining implements of death in their stinking paws.  With a brutal cry, Gaunt kicked his way through a burning set of doors and fired his bolt pistol. He was a tall, powerful shape in the swirling smoke, a striding figure with a long coat sweeping like a cloak from his broad shoulders. His bright eyes tightened in his lean, grim face and he wheeled and fired again into the gloom. In the smoke-shadows nearby, red-eyed shapes shrieked and burst, spraying fluid across the stonework. Las fire cut the air near him. He turned and fired, and then took the staircase at a run, vaulting over the bodies of the fallen. There was a struggling group up ahead, on the main landing. Two bloodied fighting men of the Tanith militia, wrestling with Sym at the doors to the launch silos.  Let us through, you bastard! Gaunt could hear one of them crying, Youd leave us here to die! Let us through! Gaunt saw the autopistol in the hand of the other too late. It fired the moment before he ploughed into them. Raging, he broke ones jaw with the butt of his bolter, knocking the man backwards to the head of the stairs. He picked up the other and threw him over the stair rail into the smoke below.  Sym lay in a pool of blood. I   Ive signalled the carrier fleet, as you ordered for the final withdrawal Leave me and get aboard the cutter or Sym began.  Shut up! Gaunt snapped, trying to lift him, his hand slick with the mans blood. Were both going! T-theres no time, not for me just for you! Go, sir! Sym rasped, his voice high with pain. From the bay beyond, Gaunt heard the scream of the cutters thrusters rising to take-off readiness.  Damn it, Sym! Gaunt said. The aide seemed to reach for him, clawing at his tunic. For a second, Gaunt though Sym was trying to pull himself up so that Gaunt could carry him.  Then Syms torso exploded in a red mist and Gaunt was thrown back off his feet. At the head of the stairs, the grotesque shock troops of Chaos bayed and advanced. Sym had seen them over Gaunts shoulder, had pulled himself up and round to shield Gaunt with his own body.  Gaunt got to his feet. His first shot burst the horned skull of the nearest beast. His second and third tore apart the body of another. His fourth, fifth and sixth gutted two more and sent them spinning back into their comrades behind on the steps.  His seventh was a dull clack of dry metal. Hurling the spent bolter aside, Gaunt backed away towards the silo bay doors. He could smell the rancid scents of Chaos over the smoke now, and hear the buzz of the maggot-flies. In a second they would be on him. Autocannon fire blasted into the heathen nightmares, sustained heavy fire from an angle nearby. Gaunt turned, and saw the boy, the piper with the fish tattoo. He was laying down an arc of covering fire from the portico of the silo bay with a sentrys autocannon that he had rested across the stonework. Get in! The last cutters waiting for you! cried the boy. Gaunt threw himself through the bay doors into the fierce whirlwind of the cutters engine backwash. The side hatch was just closing and he scrambled through, losing the tails of his coat to the biting hinge.  Enemy weapons fire resounded off the hull. Gaunt was face down on the cabin floor, drenched in blood, looking up at the terrified faces of the Munitorium officials who made up this last evacuation flight to the fleet.  Open the door again! he yelled. Open it again! None of them moved to do so. Gaunt hauled himself up and heaved on the hatch lever. The door thumped open and the boy scrambled inside.  Gaunt dragged him clear of the hatch and yanked it shut. Now! he bellowed down the cabin to the pilots bay. Go now if youre going! The cutter rose from the tower bay hard and fast, lifter jets screaming as they were jammed into overdrive. Aerial laser fire exploded the brass orchid-shutters around them and clipped a landing stanchion. Hovering, the cutter wobbled. Below it, Tanith Magna was a blazing inferno. Forgetting fuel tolerances, flight discipline, even his own mothers name, the pilot hammered the main thrusters to maximum and the cutter fired itself up through the black smoke like a bullet.  Left to die, the forests burned. Gaunt fell against a bulkhead and clawed his way to a porthole. Just like in his dreams  fire, like a flower. Blossoming. Pale, greenish fire, scuttling like it was alive. Eating the world, the whole world. Ibram Gaunt gazed into his reflection, his own lean, pale, bloody face. Trees, blazing like the heart of a star, rushed past behind his eyes.  High over the cold, mauve, marbled world of Nameth, Gaunts ships hung like creatures of the deep marine places. Three great troop carriers, their ash-grey, crenellated hulls vaulted like monstrous cathedrals, and the long, muscular escort frigate Navarre, spined and blistered with lance weapons and turrets, hooked and angular like a woodwasp, two kilometres long.  In his stateroom on the Navarre, Gaunt reviewed the latest survey intelligence. Tanith was lost, part of a conquered wedge of six planet systems that fell to the Chaos armada pincer which Macaroth had allowed to slip behind his over-eager war-front. Now Crusade forces were doubling back and re-engaging the surprise enemy. Sporadic reports had come in of a thirty-six hour deep-space engagement of capital ships near the Circudus. The Imperial Crusaders now faced a war on two fronts.  Gaunts ruthless retreat had salvaged three and a half thousand fighting men, just over half of the Tanith regiments, and most of their equipment. The cruellest, most cynical view could call it a victory of sorts. Gaunt slid a data-slate out from under a pile of other documents on his desk and eyed it. It was the transcript of the communiqu from Macaroth himself, applauding Gaunts survival instinct and his great feat in salvaging for the crusade a significant force of men. Macaroth had not seen fit to mention the loss of a planet and its population. He spoke of Colonel-Commissar Gaunts correct choice, and frank evaluation of an impossible situation, and ordered him to a holding position at Nameth to await deployment.  It made Gaunt queasy. He tossed the slate aside. The shutter opened and Kreff entered. Kreff was the frigates executive officer, a hard-faced, shaven-headed man in the emerald, tailored uniform of the Segmentum Pacificus Fleet. He saluted, a pointless over-formality given that he had been covering as Gaunts adjutant in Syms place, and had been in and out of the room ten times an hour since Gaunt came aboard.  Anything? Gaunt asked. The astropaths tell us that something may be coming soon. Perhaps our orders. There is a current, a feeling. And also, uhmKreff was obviously uncomfortable. He didnt know Gaunt and vice versa. It had taken Sym four years to get used to the commissar.  Sym  What is it? Gaunt asked. I wondered if you would care to discuss our more immediate concern? The morale of the men. Gaunt got up. Okay, Kreff. Speak your mind. Kreff hesitated. I didnt mean with me. There is a deputation from the troop-ships Gaunt turned hard at this. A what? A deputation of Tanith. They want to speak to you. They came aboard thirty minutes ago. Gaunt took his bolt pistol out of the holster slung over his chair back and checked the magazine. Is this your discreet way of announcing a mutiny, Kreff?  Kreff shook his head and laughed humourlessly. He seemed relieved when Gaunt reholstered his weapon. How many? Fifteen. Mostly enlisted men. Few of the officers came out alive. Send three of them in. Just three. They can choose who.Gaunt sat down behind his desk again. He thought about putting his cap on, his jacket. He looked across the cabin and saw his own reflection in the vast bay port. Two metres twenty of solid bone and sinew, the narrow, dangerous face that so well matched his name, the cropped blond hair. He wore his high-waisted dress breeches with their leather braces, a sleeveless undershirt and jack boots. His jacket and cap gave him command and authority. Barearmed, he gave himself physical power.  The shutter clanked and three men entered. Gaunt viewed them without comment. One was tall, taller and older than Gaunt and built heavily, if a little paunchy. His arms were like hams and were decorated with blue spirals. His beard was shaggy, and his eyes might once have twinkled. The second was slim and dark, with sinister good looks that were almost reptilian. He had a blue star tattooed across his right eye. The third was the boy, the piper. Lets know you, Gaunt said simply. Im Corbec, said the big man. This is Rawne. The snake nodded. And you know the boy. Corbec said. Not his name. Milo, the boy said clearly. Brin Milo. I imagine youre here to tell me that the men of Tanith want me dead, said Gaunt simply. Perfectly true, Rawne said. Gaunt was impressed. None of them even bothered to acknowledge his rank and seniority. Not a sir, not a commissar. Do you know why I did what I did? Gaunt asked. Do you know why I ordered the regiments off Tanith and left it to die? Do you know why I refused all your pleas to let you turn and fight? It was our right Rawne began. Our world died, Colonel-Commissar Gaunt, Corbec said, the title bringing Gaunts head up sharp. We saw it flame out from the windows of our transports. You should have let us stand and fight. We would have died for Tanith.  You still can, just somewhere else. Gaunt got to his feet. Youre not men of Tanith anymore. You werent when you were camped out on the Founding Fields. Youre Imperial Guard, servants of the Emperor first and nothing else second.  He turned to face the window port, his back to them. I mourn the loss of any world, any life. I did not want to see Tanith die, nor did I want to abandon it. But my duty is to the Emperor, and the Sabbat Worlds Crusade must be fought and won for the good of the entire Imperium. The only thing you could have done if I had left you on Tanith was die. If thats what you want, I can provide you with many opportunities. What I need is soldiers, not corpses. Gaunt gazed out into space. Use your loss, dont be crippled by it. Put the pain into your fighting spirit. Think hard! Most men who join the Guard never see their homes again. You are no different. But most have a home to return to! Corbec spat. Most can look forward to living through a campaign and mustering to settle on some world their leader has conquered and won. Slaydo made me a gift after Balhaut. He gave me the military rank of colonel and granted me settlement rights to the first planet I win. Help me by doing your job, and Ill help you by sharing that with you. Is that a bribe? Rawne asked. Gaunt shook his head. Just a promise. We need each other. I need an able, motivated army, you need something to take the pain away, something to fight for, something to look forward to.  Gaunt saw something in the reflection on the glass. He didnt turn his head. Is that a laspistol, Rawne? Would you have come here and murdered me?  Rawne, grinned. What makes you put that in the past tense, commissar? Gaunt turned. What do I have here then? A regiment or a mutiny? Corbec met his gaze. The men will need convincing. Youve made ghosts of them, hollow echoes. Well take word back to the troop-ships of why you did what you did and what the future might hold. Then its up to them. They need to rally around their officers. Rawne laughed. There are none! Our command staff were all on the Founding Fields trying to embark the men when the bombardment started. None of them made it off Tanith alive. Gaunt nodded. But the men elected you to lead the deputation? Youre leaders. Or simply bold and dumb enough to be the ones to front you, Corbec said. Its the same thing, Gaunt said. Colonel Corbec. Major Rawne. You can appoint your own juniors and unit chiefs and report back to me in six hours with an assessment of morale. I should have our deployment by then. They glanced at each other, taken aback. Dismissed, prompted Gaunt. The trio turned away confused. Milo? Wait, please, Gaunt said. The boy stopped as the shutter closed after the two men. I owe you, Gaunt told him baldly.  And you paid me back. Im not militia or Guard. I only got off Tanith alive because you brought me. Because of your service to me. Milo paused. The Elector himself ordered me to stay with you, to see to your needs. I was just doing my duty. Those two brought you along because they thought the sight of you might mollify me, didnt they? Theyre not stupid, noted Milo. Gaunt sat back at his desk. Neither are you. I have need of an adjutant, a personal aide. Its dogsbody, gopher work mostly, and the harder stuff you can learn. It would help me to have a Tanith in the post if my working relationship with them is going to continue.  Before Milo could answer, the shutter slammed open again and Kreff entered, a slate in his hand. He saluted again. Weve got our orders, sir, he said. Distant, rumbling explosions seemed a constant feature of the deadzone on Blackshard. The persistent crump of heavy gunnery drummed the low, leaden sky over the ridgeline. An earthwork had been built up along the ridges spine and, under hardened bunkers, a detachment of Imperial Guard  six units of the 10th Royal Sloka  were readying to mobilise.  Colonel Thoren walked the line. The men looked like world-killers in their ornate battledress: crested, enamelled scarlet and silver warsuits built by the artisans of Sloka to inspire terror in the enemy.  But perhaps not this enemy. General Hadraks orders had been precise, but Thorens heart was heavy. He had no relish for the approaching push. He had no doubt at all it would cost him dearly. To push blind, unsupported, into treacherous unknown territory in the hope of finding a wormhole into the enemy positions that might not even be there. The prospect made him feel sick. Thorens subaltern drew his attention suddenly to the double file of sixty men moving down the covered transit trench towards them. Scrawny ruffians, dressed in black, camo-cloaks draped over them, plastered to their bodies by the rain.  Who in the name of Balors blood? Thorne began. Halting his column, the leader, a huge blackguard with a mess of tangled beard and a tattoo   a tattoo!marched up to Thoren and saluted.  Colonel Corbec, 1st Tanith. First-and-Only. General Hadrak has ordered us forward to assist you. Tanith? Where the hell is that? asked Thoren. It isnt, replied the big man genially. The general said you were set to advance on the enemy positions over the deadzone. Suggested you might need a covert scouting force seeing as how your boys scarlet armour stands out like a baboons arse.  Thoren felt his face flush. Now listen to me, you piece  A shadow fell across them. Colonel Thoren, I presume? Gaunt dropped down into the dugout from the trench boarding. My regiment arrived here on Blackshard yesterday night, with orders to reinforce General Hadraks efforts to seize the Chaos stronghold. That presupposes cooperative efforts between our units.  Thoren nodded. This was Gaunt, the upstart colonel-commissar, it had to be. Hed heard stories. Appraise me, please, said Gaunt. Thoren waved up an aide who flipped up a map-projector, and displayed a fuzzy image of the deadzone. The foe are dug in deep in the old citadel ruins. The citadel had a sizeable standing defence force, so theyre well equipped. Chaos cultists, mostly, about seventeen thousand able fighting men. We also he paused. Gaunt raised a questioning eyebrow. We believe there may be other abominations in there. Chaos spawn. Thoren breathed heavily. Most of the main fighting is contained in this area here, while artillery duels blight the other fronts.  Gaunt nodded. Most of my strength is deployed along the front line. But General Hadrak also directed us to this second front.  Thoren indicated the map again. The foe are up to more than simply holding us out. They know sooner or later well break through, so they must be up to something  trying to complete something, perhaps. Recon showed that this flank of the city might be vulnerable to a smaller force. There are channels and ducts leading in under the old walls, a rat-maze, really.  My boys specialise in rat-mazes, Gaunt said. You want to go in first? Thoren asked. Its mud and tunnels. The Tanith are light infantry, youre armoured and heavy. Let us lead through and then follow us in support when weve secured a beachhead. Bring up some support weapons. Thoren nodded. Very well, colonel-commissar. Gaunt and Corbec withdrew to their men. This will be the first blooding for this regiment, for the Tanith First-and-Only, began Gaunt. For Gaunts Ghosts, someone murmured. Mad Larkin, Corbec was sure. Gaunt smiled. Gaunts Ghosts. Dont disappoint me. They needed no other instructions. At Corbecs gesture, they hurried forward in pairs, slipping their camo-cloaks down as shrouds around them, lasguns held loose and ready. The hybrid weave of the hooded cloaks blurred to match the dark grey mud of the ridgeway, and each man stooped to smear his cheeks and brow with wet mud before slipping over the earthwork.  Thoren watched the last one disappear and then span the trench macro-periscope around. He looked out, but of the sixty plus men who had just passed his position, there was no sign.  Where in the name of Solan did they go? he breathed. Gaunt was amazed. Hed seen them practise and train in the belly holds of the big carrier ships, but now here, in the wild of a real deadzone, their skills startled him. They were all but invisible in the stinking mire, just tinyblurs of movement edging between stacks of debris and over mounds of wreckage towards the slumped but massive curtain walls of the citadel.  He pulled his own Tanith camo-cloak around him. It had been part of his deal with Corbec: he insisted on leading them in to assure loyalty, they insisted he didnt give their position away.  The micro-bead in his ear tickled. It was Corbec. First units at the tunnels now. Move up close in pairs. Gaunt touched his throat mike. Hostiles? he asked. A little light knife work, crackled the reply. A few moment later he was entering the dripping, dark mouth of the rubble tunnel. Five Chaos-bred warriors in the orange robes of their cult lay dead. Before him, the Tanith were forming up. Corbec was wiping blood from the blade of his long, silver knife.  Lets go, said Gaunt. The Elector of Tanith, may his soul rest, had not lied about anything, Gaunt decided. The Ghosts had proved their cunning stealth crossing the open waste of the deadzone, and he had no clue as to how they threaded their way through the crazy lightless warren of the tunnels so surely. They do not get lost, the Elector had boasted, and it was true. Gaunt suspected that the foe had assumed nothing bigger than a cockroach would ever find its way through those half-collapsed, deathtrap tunnels.  But Corbecs men had, effortlessly, in scant minutes. Rising from the tunnels ends inside the curtain wall of the city, and taking long, silver Tanith knives to pallid, blotchy throats, they had burned their way in through the enemys hindquarters. Now the Tanith First-and-Only were proving they could fight. Just like the Elector had said. From behind a shattered pillar, Gaunt blasted with his bolter, blowing two cultists apart and destroying a doorway. Around him, the advancing Tanith lacerated the air with precise shots from five dozen lasguns. Near to Gaunt, a sharp-faced, older Tanith Gaunt had heard the men call Larkin was sniping cultists off the top of the nearest balconies. His eye was tremendous. A little further on, a huge man, a gentle giant called Bragg, was shouldering the heavy bolter and taking down walls and columns. The big weapon had originally been pintlemounted on a sled, but Bragg had torn it off its mount and slung it up like a rifle. Gaunt had never seen a heavy bolter carried by an unarmoured man before. The Tanith called Bragg Try Again Bragg. He was a terrible shot, admittedly, but with firepower like that he could afford to be sloppy.  Just ahead, a six man fire-team led by Corbec gained the entrance to a temple building complex, grenaded the doorway and went in with lasguns, paired off to give bounding cover.  Heavy fire in my section! Corbec radioed to Gaunt. Some kind of church or temple. Could be a primary target. Gaunt acknowledged. He would move more teams up. Creeping down the aisle of the massive temple, Corbec edged through rubble and heavy crossfire. He nodded a pair past him  Rawne and Suth  and then the next. His own cover partner, Forgal, bellied up close in the mica dust of the temple floor and unslung his lasgun.  Down there, he hissed, his eyes as sharp as ever. Theres a lower storey down behind the altar. Theyve got a lot of defence around that doorway. The big arch under the stained-glass. It was true. You smell that? Rawne asked over the radio. Corbec did. Decay, stale sweat, dead blood. Rank and harsh, oozing from the crypt. Forgal began to crawl forward. A lucky shot vaporised the top of his head. Sacred Feth! Corbec howled and opened up in rage, bringing the entire stained glass window down in a sheet onto the altar.  Rawne and Suth took advantage of the confusion to grab a few more yards. Rawne unwrapped a tube-charge and hurled it over-arm into the archway.  The blast was deafening. Gaunt heard Corbecs call in his ear-piece. Get in here! He scrambled into the smoky interior of the temple. At the door, he paused. Larkin! Bragg! Orcha! Varl! With me! You three, cordon the door! Cluggan, take two teams down the flank of the building and scout!  Gaunt entered the chapel, mashing broken glass under foot. He could smell the stink. Corbec and Rawne were waiting for him, their other men stood around, watching with lasguns ready. Something down here, Rawne said and led Gaunt on down the littered steps. Gaunt slammed fresh rounds home into his boltgun, then holstered it and picked up Forgals fallen las-gun.  Beneath the chapel was an undercroft. Dead cultists were strewn like rag dolls around the smouldering floor. In the centre of the chamber stood a rusty, metallic box, two metres square, its lid etched with twisted sigils of Chaos.  Gaunt reached out. The metal was warm. It pulsed. He snatched his hand back. What is it? asked Corbec. I dont think any of us want to know, Gaunt said. Some relic of the enemy, some unholy object, an icon  Whatever, its something valuable to these monsters, something theyre defending to the last. That Sloka colonel was sure there was a reason they were holding on, Corbec said. Maybe theyre hoping support will arrive in time to save this.  Lets spoil those chances. I want a systematic withdrawal from this point, back out under the wall. Each man is to leave his tube-charges here. Rawne, collect them and rig them  you seem to be good with explosives. Within minutes, the Ghosts had withdrawn. Rawne crouched and connected the firing pins of the small but potent anti-personnel charges. Gaunt watched him and the door. Pick it up, Rawne. We havent much time. The enemy arent going to leave this area open for long. Nearly done, Rawne said. Check the door again, sir. I thought I heard something. The sir should have warned him. As Gaunt turned, Rawne rose and clubbed him around the back of the head with his fist. Gaunt dropped, stunned, and Rawne rolled him over next to the charges. A fitting place for scum like you to die, ghost maker! he murmured. Down here amongst the vermin and the filth. Its so tragic that the brave commissar didnt make it out, but the cultists were all over us. Rawne drew his laspistol and lowered it towards Gaunts head.  Gaunt kicked out and brought Rawne down. He rolled and slammed into him, punching him once, twice. Blood marked Rawnes mouth.  He tried to hit again but Gaunt was so much bigger. He struck Rawne so hard he was afraid hed broken his neck. The Tanith lolled in the dust. Gaunt got up, and eyed the timer setting. It was just dropping under two minutes. Time to leave. Gaunt turned. But in the doorway of the room, the warriors of Chaos moved towards him. The blast sent a column of dirt and fire up into the sky that could be seen from the Guard trenches across the deadzone. Six minutes later, the defenders big guns stopped and fell silent. Then all firing ceased completely from the enemy lines.  Guard units moved in, cautiously at first. They found the cultists dead at their positions. Each one had, in unison, taken his own life, as if in response to some great loss. In the conclusion of his report on the victory at Blackshard, General Hadrak surmised that the destruction of the Chaos relic, which had given meaning to the cult defence, robbed them of the will or need to continue. Hadrak also noted the significant role in the victory played by the newly founded Tanith 1st, which had supplemented his own forces. Though as C-in-C of the Blackshard action, he took overall credit for the victory, he was magnanimous in acknowledging the work of Gaunts Ghosts, and particularly recommended their stealth and scouting abilities.  Colonel-Commissar Gaunt, wounded in the stomach and shoulder, emerged alive from the deadzone twenty minutes after the blast and was treated by medical teams before returning to his frigate. He might have made his way out of the enemy lines faster, had he not carried the unconscious body of one of his officers, a Major Rawne, back to safety.  Stiff with drug-dulled pain, Gaunt walked down the companion way of the troop carrier and into the holding bay. Nearly nine hundred of the Tanith were billeted here. They looked up from their weapons drills and Gaunt felt the silence on him.  First blood to you, he said to them. First blood to Tanith. The first wound of vengeance. Savour it. By his side, Corbec began to clap. The men picked it up, more and more, until the hold shook with applause. Gaunt eyed the crowd. Maybe there was a future here, after all. A regiment worth the leading, a prize worth chasing all the way to glory.  His eyes found Major Rawne in the crowd. Their eyes fixed. Rawne was not applauding. That made Gaunt laugh. He turned to Milo and gestured to the Tanith pipes cradled in his aides hands. Now you can play something, he told him. Gaunt walked the line through the early morning, the stink of the Monthax jungle swards filling and sickening his senses. Tanith, working stripped to the waists, digging the wet ooze with entrenching tools to fill sacking, paused to nod at his greetings, exchange a few words with him, or ask cautious questions about the fight to come.  Gaunt answered as best he could. As a commissar, a political officer, charged with morale and propaganda, he could turn a good, pompous phrase. But as a colonel, he felt a duty of truth to his men. And the truth was, he knew little of what to expect. It would be bitter, he knew that much, though the commissar part of him spared the men that thought. Gaunt spoke of courage and glory in general, uplifting terms, talking softly and firmly as his mentor, Commissar-General Oktar, had taught him all those years ago when he was just a raw cadet with the Hyrkans. Save the yelling and screaming for battle, Ibram. Before that comes, build their morale with gentle encouragement. Make it look like you havent a care in the world.  Gaunt prided himself on knowing not only the names of all his men, but a little about each of them too. A private joke here, a common interest there. Oktars way, tried and tested , Emperor rest his soul these long years. Gaunt tried to memorise each muddy, smiling face as he passed along. He knew his soul would be damned the day he was told  Trooper so-and-so had fallen and he couldnt bring the mans face to mind. The dead will always haunt you, Oktar had told him, so make certain the ghosts are friendly. If only Oktar had known the literal truth of that advice. Gaunt paused at the edge of a dispersal gully and smiled to himself at the memory. Beyond, some troopers were kicking a balled sack of mud around in an impromptu off-watch game. The ball came his way, and he hoisted it back to them on the point of his boot. Let them have their fun while it lasts. How many would be alive to play the game again tomorrow?  How many indeed? There were losses and losses. Some worthy, some dreadful, and some plain unnecessary. Still the memories dogged his mind in these crawling hours of waiting. Praise be the Emperor that Gaunts losses of brave, common troopers would never be as great, as wholesale or as senseless as that day on Voltemand, a year before  TWO A BLOODING  They were a good two hours into the dark, black-trunked forests of the Voltemand Mirewoods, tracks churning the filthy ooze and the roar of their engines resonating from the sickly canopy of leaves above, when Colonel Ortiz saw death.  It wore red, and stood in the trees to the right of the track, in plain sight, unmoving, watching his column of Basilisks as they passed along the trackway. It was the lack of movement that chilled Ortiz. He did a double take, first seeing the figure as they passed it before realising what it was.  Almost twice a mans height, frighteningly broad, armour the colour of rusty blood, crested by recurve brass antlers. The face was a graven deaths head. Daemon. Chaos Warrior. World Eater. Ortiz snapped his gaze back to it and felt his blood drain away. He fumbled for his radio link. Alarm! Alarm! Ambush to the right! he yelled into the set. Gears slammed and whined, and hundreds of tons of mechanised steel shuddered, foundered and slithered on the muddy track, penned, trapped, too cumbersome to react quickly.  By then the Chaos Space Marine had begun to move. So had its six comrades, each emerging from the woods around them.  Panic seized Ortizs convoy cluster: the ten-vehicle forward portion of a heavy column of eighty flame-and-feather painted Basilisk tanks of the Serpents, the Ketzok 17th Armoured Regiment, sent in to support the frontal push of the Royal Volpone 50th, the so-called Bluebloods. The Ketzok had the firepower to flatten a city, but caught on a strangled trackway, in a thick woodland, with no room to turn or traverse, and with monstrous enemies at close quarters, far too close to bring the main guns to bear, they were all but helpless. Panic alarms spread backwards down the straggled column, from convoy portion to portion. Ortiz heard tree trunks shatter as some commanders tried to haul their machines off the track.  The World Eaters started baying as they advanced, wrenching out of their augmented throats deep, inhuman calls that whooped across the trackway and shivered the metal of the tank armour. They howled the name of the bloody abomination they worshipped.  Small arms! Ortiz ordered. Use the pintle mounts! As he spoke, he cranked round the autocannon mounted on his vehicles rear and angled it at the nearest monster.  The killing started. The rasping belch of flamers reached his ears and he heard the screams of men cooking inside their superheated tank hulls. The Chaos Marine he had first spotted reached the Basilisk ahead of his and began to chop its shell like firewood with a chain-axe. Sparks blew up from punctured metal. Sparks, flames, metal shards, meat.  Screaming, Ortiz trained his mounted gun on the World Eater and fired. He shot long at first, but corrected before the monster could turn. The creature didnt seem to feel the first hits. Ortiz clenched the trigger and streamed the heavy tracer fire at the red spectre. At last the figure shuddered, convulsed and then blew apart. Ortiz cursed. The World Eaters soaked up the sort of punishment that would kill a Leman Russ. He realised his ammo drum was almost empty. He was snapping it free and shouting to his bombardier for a fresh one when the shadow fell on him.  Ortiz turned. Another Chaos Marine stood on the rear of the Basilisk behind him, a giant blocking out the pale sunlight. It stooped, and howled its victory shout into his face, assaulting him with concussive sonic force and wretched odour.  Ortiz recoiled as if he had been hit by a macro shell. He could not move. The World Eater chuckled, a macabre, deep growl from behind the visor, a seismic rumble. The chainsword in its fist whined and swung up The blow didnt fall. The monster rocked, two or three times, swayed for a moment. And exploded. Smeared with grease and ichor, Ortiz scrambled up out of his hatch. He was suddenly aware of a whole new layer of gunfire  sustained lasgun blasts, the chatter of support weapons, the crump of grenades. Another force was moving out of the woods, crushing the Chaos Marine ambush hard against the steel flanks of his artillery machines.  As Ortiz watched, the remaining World Eaters died. One was punctured dozens of times by lasgun fire and fell face down into the mire. Another was flamed repeatedly as he ripped apart the wreck of a Basilisk with his steel hands. The flames touched off the tanks magazine and the marine was incinerated with his victims. His hideous roar lingered long after the white-hot flames had consumed him.  The columns saviours emerged from the forest around them. Imperial Guards: tall, dark-haired, pale-skinned men in black fatigues, a scruffy, straggle-haired mob almost invisible in their patterned camo-cloaks. Ortiz heard strange, disturbing pipe music strike up a banshee wail in the close forest, and a victory yelp erupted from the men. It was met by cheers and whoops from his own crews.  Ortiz leapt down into the mud and approached the Imperial Guardsmen through the drifting smoke. Im Colonel Ortiz. You boys have my earnest thanks, he said. Who are you? The nearest man, a giant with unruly black hair, a tangled, braided beard and thick, bare arms decorated with blue spiral tattoos, smiled jauntily and saluted, bringing up his lasgun. Colonel Corbec, Tanith First-and-Only. Our pleasure, Im sure. Ortiz nodded back. He found he was still shaking. He could barely bring himself to look down at the dead Chaos Marine, sprawled in the mud nearby. Takes discipline to ambush an ambush. Your men certainly know stealth. Why is  He got no further. The bearded giant, Corbec, suddenly froze, a look of dismay on his face. Then he was leaping forward with a cry, tackling Ortiz down into the blue-black mud.  The dead World Eater lifted his horned skull out of the muck and half-raised his bolter. But that was all. Then a shrieking chainsword decapitated him.  The heavy, dead parts flopped back into the mud. One of them rolled. Ibram Gaunt brandished with his keening chain sword like a duellist and then thumbed it to idle. He turned to Corbec and Ortiz as they got up, caked in black filth. Ortiz stared at the tall, powerful man in the long dark coat and cap of an Imperial Commissar. His face was blade thin, his eyes as dark as space. He looked like he could rip a world asunder with his hands.  Meet the boss, Corbec chuckled at Ortizs side. Colonel-Commissar Gaunt. Ortiz nodded, wiping his face. So, youre Gaunts Ghosts. Major Gilbear poured himself a brandy from the decanter on the teak stand. Just who the hell are these awful barbarian scum? he asked, sipping from the huge crystal balloon. At his desk, General Noches Sturm put down his pen and sat back. Oh, please, help yourself to my brandy,  Gilbear, he muttered, though the sarcasm was lost on his massive aide. Gilbear reclined on a chaise beside the flickering amber displays of the message-caster, and gazed at his commander. Ghosts? Thats what they call them, isnt it? Sturm nodded, observing his senior adjutant. Gilbear  Gizhaum Danver De Banzi Haight Gilbear, to give him his full name  was the second son of the Haight Gilbears of Solenhofen, the royal house of Volpone. He was nearly two and half metres tall and arrogantly powerful, with the big, blunt, bland features and languid, hooded eyes of the aristocracy. Gilbear wore the grey and gold uniform of the Royal Volpone 50th, the so-called Bluebloods, who believed they were the noblest regiment in the Imperial Guard.  Sturm sat back in his chair. They are indeed called Ghosts. Gaunts Ghosts. And theyre here because I requested them.  Gilbear cocked a disdainful eyebrow. You requested them? Weve had nigh on six weeks, and we cant shake the enemy from Voltis City. They command everything west of the Bokore Valley. Warmaster Macaroth is not pleased. All the while they hold Voltemand, they have a road into the heart of the Sabbat Worlds. So you see I need a lever. I need to introduce a new element to break our deadlock. That rabble? Gilbear sneered. I watched them as they mustered after the drop-ships landed them. Hairy, illiterate primitives, with tattoos and nose rings.  Sturm lifted a data-slate from his desktop and shook it at Gilbear. Have you read the reports General Hadrak filed after the Sloka took Blackshard? He credits Gaunts mob with the decisive incursion. It seems they excel at stealth raids.  Sturm got to his feet and adjusted the sit of his resplendent Blueblood staff uniform. The study was bathed in yellow sunlight that streamed in through the conservatory doors at the end, softened by net drapes. He rested his hand on the antique globe of Voltemand in its mahogany stand by the desk and span it idly, gazing out across the grounds of Vortimor House. This place had been the country seat of one of Voltemands most honoured noble families, a vast, grey manse, fringed with mauve climbing plants, situated in ornamental parkland thirty kilometres south of Voltis City. It had been an ideal location to establish his Supreme Headquarters. Outside, on the lawn, a squad of Blueblood elite in full battle dress were executing a precision synchronised drill with chainswords. Metal flashed and whirled, perfect and poised. Beyond them, a garden of trellises and arbours led down to a boating lake, calm and smoky in the afternoon light. Navigation lights flashed slowly on the barbed masts of the communications array in the herbarium. Somewhere in the stable block, strutting gaudcocks whooped and called.  You wouldnt think there was a war on, mused Sturm. He wondered where the previous owners of the manse were now. Did they make it off world before the first assault? Are they huddled and starving in the belly hold of a refugee ship, reduced overnight to a level with their former vassals? Or are they bone-ash in the ruins of Kosdorf, or on the burning Metis Road? Or did they die screaming and melting at the orbital port when the legions of Chaos first fell on their world, vaporised with the very ships they struggled to escape in?  Who cares? thought Sturm. The war is all that matters. The glory, the crusade, the Emperor. He would only care for the fallen when the bloody head of Chanthar, demagogue of the Chaos army that held Voltis Citadel, was served up to him on a carving dish. And even then, he wouldnt care much. Gilbear was on his feet, refilling his glass. This Gaunt, hes quite a fellow, isnt he? Wasnt he with the Hyrkan 8th?  Sturm cleared his throat, Led them to victory at Balhaut. One of old Slaydos chosen favourites. Made him a colonel  commissar, no less. It was decided he had the prestige to hammer a new regiment or two into shape, so they sent him to the planet Tanith to supervise the rounding there. A Chaos space fleet hit the world that very night, and he got out with just a few thousand men.  Gilbear nodded. Thats what I heard. Skin of his teeth. But thats his career in tatters, stuck with an under-strength rabbit-like that. Macaroth wont transfer him, will he? Sturm managed a small smile. Our beloved overlord does not look kindly on the favourites of his predecessor. Especially as Slaydo granted Gaunt and a handful of others the settlement rights of the first world they conquered. He and his Tanith rabble are an embarrassment to the new regime. But that serves us well. They will fight hard because they have everything to prove, and everything to win.  I say, said Gilbear suddenly, lowering his glass. What if they do win? I mean, if theyre as useful as you say? They will facilitate our victory, Sturm said, pouring himself a drink. They will not achieve anything else. We will serve Lord Macaroth twofold, by taking this world for him, and ridding him of Gaunt and his damn Ghosts.  You were expecting us? Gaunt asked, riding on the top of Ortizs Basilisk as the convoy moved on. Colonel Ortiz nodded, leaning back against the raised top-hatch cover. We were ordered up the line last night to dig in at the north end of the Bokore Valley and pound the enemy fortifications on the western side. Soften them up, I suppose. En route, I got coded orders sent, telling us to meet your regiment at Pavis Crossroads and transport you as we advanced.  Gaunt removed his cap and ran a hand through his short fair hair. We were ordered across country to the crossroads, all right, he responded. Told to meet transport there for the next leg. But my scouts picked up the World Eaters stench, so we doubled back and met you early.  Ortiz shuddered. Good thing for us. Gaunt gazed along the line of the convoy as they moved on, taking in the massive bulk of the Basilisks as they ground up the snaking mud-track through the sickly, dim forest. His men were riding on the flanks of the great war machines, a dozen or more per vehicle, joking with the Serpent crews, exchanging drinks and smokes, some cleaning weapons or even snoozing as the lurch of the metal beasts allowed.  So Sturms sending you in? Ortiz asked presently. Right down the rivers floodplain to the gates of Voltis. He thinks we can take the city where fifty thousand of his Bluebloods have failed.  Can you? Well see, Gaunt said, without the flicker of a smile. The Ghosts are new, unproven but for a skirmish on Blackshard. But they have certain strengths. He fell silent, and seemed to be admiring the gold and turquoise lines of the feather serpent design painted on the barrel of the Basilisks main weapon. Its open beak was the muzzle. All the Ketzok machines were rich with similar decorations. Ortiz whistled low to himself. Down the Bokore Valley into the mouth of hell. I dont envy you. Now Gaunt smiled. Just you keep pounding the western hills and keep them busy. In fact, blow them all away to kingdom come before we get there.  Deal, laughed Ortiz. And dont drop your damn aim! Gaunt added with a threatening chuckle. Remember you have friends in the valley!  Two vehicles back, Corbec nodded his thanks as he took the dark thin cigar his Basilisk commander offered. Doranz, the Serpent said, introducing himself. Charmed, Corbec said. The cigar tasted of licorice, but he smoked it anyway. Lower down the hull of the tank, by Corbecs sprawled feet, the boy Milo was cleaning out the chanters of his Tanith pipe. It wheezed and squealed hoarsely. Doranz blanched. Ill tell you this: when I heard that boys piping today, that hell-note, it almost scared me more than the damn blood cries of the enemy.  Corbec chuckled. The pipe has its uses. It rallies us, it spooks the foe. Back home, the forests move and change. The pipes were a way to follow and not get lost. Where is home? Doranz asked. Nowhere now, Corbec said and returned to his smoke. On the back armour of another Basilisk, hulking Bragg, the biggest of the Ghosts, and small, wiry Larkin, were dicing with two of the tanks gun crew. Larkin had already won a gold signet ring set with a turquoise skull. Bragg had lost all his smokes, and two bottles of sacra. Every now and then, the lurch of the tank beneath them would flip the dice, or slide them under an exhaust baffle, prompting groans and accusations of fixing and cheating.  Up by the top hatch with the vehicles commander, Major Rawne watched the game without amusement. The Basilisk commander felt uneasy about his passenger. Rawne was slender, dark and somehow dangerous. A starburst tattoo covered one eye. He was not likeable or open like the other Ghosts seemed to be. So, major whats your commissar like? the commander began, by way of easing the silence. Gaunt? Rawne asked, turning slowly to face the Serpent. Hes a despicable bastard who left my world to die and one day I will slay him with my own hands.  Oh, said the commander and found something rather more important to do down below. Ortiz passed Gaunt his flask. The afternoon was going and they were losing the light. Ortiz consulted a map-slate, angling it to show Gaunt. Navigation puts us about two kilometres or so short of Pavis Crossroads. Weve made good time. Well be on it before dark. Im glad, I didnt want to have to turn on the floods and running lights to continue.  What do we know about Pavis? Gaunt asked. Last reports were it was held by a battalion of Bluebloods. That was at oh-five-hundred this morning. Wouldnt hurt to check, Gaunt mused. There are worse things than rolling into an ambush position at twilight, but not many. Cluggan! He called down the hull to a big, grey-haired Ghost sat with others playing cards. Sir! Cluggan said, scrambling back up the rocking Basilisk. Sergeant, take six men, jump down and scout ahead of the column. Were two kilometres short of this crossroads, Gaunt showed Cluggan the map. Should be clear, but after our tangle with the damn World Eaters wed best be sure.  Cluggan saluted and slid back to his men. In a few moments they had gathered up their kits and weapons and swung down off the skirt armour onto the track. A moment more and they had vanished like smoke into the woods. That is impressive, Ortiz said. At Pavis Crossroads, the serpents spoke. Stretching their great painted beaks towards the night sky, they began their vast barrage.  Brin Milo cowered in the shadow of a medical Chimera, pressing his hands to his ears. Hed seen two battles up close: the fall of Tanith Magna and the storming of the citadel on Blackshard, but this was the first time he had ever encountered the sheer numbing wrath of armoured artillery.  The Ketzok Basilisks were dug in along the ridge in a straggled line about a mile long. They were hull-down into the grey earth, main weapons swung high, hurling death at the western hills across the valley nine kilometres away.  They were firing at will, a sustained barrage that could, Corbec had assured him, go on all night. Every second at least one gun was sounding, lighting the darkness with its fierce muzzle flash, shaking the ground with its firing and recoil.  Pavis Crossroads was a stone obelisk marking the junction of the Metis Road that ran up the valley from Voltis City, and the Mirewood track that carried on towards the east. The Serpents armour had rolled in at nightfall, ousting the encamped Bluebloods who held the junction, and deploying around the ridge-line, looking west. As the first stars began to shine, Ortizs men began their onslaught.  Milo kept his eyes sharp for the commissar, and when he saw Gaunt striding towards a tented dugout beside the orbital communication stack, accompanied by his senior officers, Milo ran to join them.  My scope! requested Gaunt over the barrage. Milo pulled the commissars brass-capped nightscope from his pack and Gaunt stepped up onto the parapet, scanning out of the dugout.  Corbec leaned up close by him, a thin black tube protruding from his beard. Gaunt glanced round. What is that thing? he asked. Corbec took it out and displayed it proudly. Cigar. Liquorice, no less. Won a box off my gun-crates CO. and I think Im getting a taste for them. See much? he added. I can see the lights of Voltis. Watch fires and shrine-lights mostly. Not so inviting. Gaunt flipped his scope shut and jumped down from the parapet, handing the device back to Milo. The boy had already set up the field-map, a glass plate in a metal frame mounted like an easel on a brass tripod. Gaunt cranked the knurled lever on the side and the glass slowly lit with bluish light. He dropped in a ceramic slide engraved with the local geography and then angled the screen to show the assembled men: Corbec, Rawne, Cluggan, Orcha and the other officers.  Bokore Valley, Gaunt said, tapping the glass viewer with the tip of his long, silver Tanith war-knife. As if for emphasis, the nearest Basilisk outside fired and the dugout shook. The field map wobbled and soil trickled in from the roof.  Four kilometres wide, twelve long, flanked to the west by steep hills where the enemy is well established. At the far end, Voltis City, the old Capital of Voltemand. Thirty metre curtain walls of basalt. Built as a fortress three hundred years ago, when they knew the art. The invading Chaos Host from off-planet seized it at day one as their main stronghold. The Volpone 50th have spent six weeks trying to crack it, but the bastards we met today show the kind of force theyve been up against. Well have a go tonight. He looked up, oblivious to the constant thunder outside. Major Rawne? Rawne stepped forward, almost reluctant to be anywhere near Gaunt. No one knew what had passed between them when they had been alone together on Blackshard, but everyone had seen Gaunt carry Rawne to safety on his shoulder, despite his own injuries. Surely that sort of action bonded men, not deepened their enmity? Rawne adjusted a dial on the field-maps edge so that the plate displayed a different section of the chart-slide. The approach is straightforward. The Bokore River runs along the wide valley floor. It is broad and slow-moving, especially at this time of year. Most of the way is choked with bulrushes and waterweed. We can move down the river channel undetected.  Youve scouted this? Gaunt asked. My squad returned not half an hour ago, Rawne said smoothly. The Bluebloods had tried it a number of times, but they are semi-armoured and the mud was too great an impediment. We are lighter  and we are good. Gaunt nodded. Corbec? The big man sucked on his cigar. His genial eyes twinkled and it made Milo smile. We move by dark, of course. In the next half-hour. Staggered squads of thirty men to spread out our traces. He tapped the map-screen at another place. Primary point of entry is the old city Watergate. Heavily defended of course. Secondary squads under Sergeant Cluggan will attempt to storm the wall at the western sanitation outfalls. I wont pretend either way will be a picnic.  Objective, Gaunt said, get inside and open the city. Well move in squads. One man in every ten will be carrying as much high explosive as he can. Squad leaders should select any man with demol experience. We provide cover for these demolition specialists to allow them to set charges that will take out sections of wall or gates.  Anything that splits the city open. Ive spoken to the Blueblood colonel. He has seven thousand men in motorised units ready to advance and take advantage of any opening we can make. They will be monitoring on channel eighty. The signal will be Thunderhead.  There was silence, silence except for the relentless hammering of the Basilisk guns. Form up and move out, Gaunt said. Outside, Ortiz stood talking to several of his senior officers, one of them Doranz. They saw the Ghost officers emerge from the dugout and orders being given.  Across the emplacement, Ortiz caught Gaunts eye. It was too loud for words, so he clenched his fist and rapped it twice against his heart, an old gesture for luck.  Gaunt nodded. Scary men, Doranz said. I almost feel sorry for the enemy. Ortiz glanced round at him. Im joking, of course, Doranz added, but Ortiz wasnt sure he was. Midnight had seen them waist deep in the stinking black water of the Bokore River reed beds, assailed by clouds of biting flies. Three hours hard trudge through the oily shallows of the old river, and now the sheer walls of Voltis rose before them, lit by cressets and braziers high up. Behind them, like a distant argument, the Basilisks spat death up into the heavens, a distant, rolling roar and a series of orange flashes on the skyline.  Gaunt adjusted his nightscope and panned it round, seeing features in the darkness as a green negative. The watergate was thirty metres across and forty tall, the mouth of a great chute and adjoining system that returned water to the Bokore once it had driven the mills inside the city. Gaunt knew that somewhere sluices must have been lowered, and the flow staunched, closing off the chutes operation. Sandbagged emplacements could be made out up in the shadows behind the gates breastwork.  He adjusted his micro-bead link. Corbec? Colm Corbec heard his commander in the darkness and acknowledged. He waded forward through the reeds to Bragg, who had hunkered down behind a rotting jetty. When youre ready Corbec invited. Bragg grinned, teeth bright in the starlight. He dragged the canvas cover off one of the two huge weapons he had lugged on his shoulders from Pavis Crossroads. The polished metal of the missile launcher had been dulled down with smears of Mirewood mud.  Try Again Bragg was a spectacularly lousy shot. But the watergate was a big target, and the missile rack held four melta-missiles.  The night exploded. Three missiles went straight up the throat of the chute. The force of the heat-blast sent stone debris, metal shards, water vapour and body parts out in a radius of fifty yards. The fourth vaporised a chunk of wall, and brought down a small avalanche of basalt chunks. For a moment the heat was so intense that Gaunts nightscope read nothing but emerald glare. Then it showed him the chiselled mouth of the watergate had become a bubbling, blazing wound in the huge wall, a ragged, slumping incision in the sheer basalt. He could hear agonised screaming from within the chute. Beyond the city wall, alarm bells and sirens rose in pandemonium. The Ghosts charged the watergate. Orcha led the first squad up the sloping drain-away under the molten arch of ruptured stone. He and three of his men swung flamers in wide arcs, scorching and scouring up unto the darkness of the echoing chute. Behind them, Corbec brought in fire teams with lasguns who darted down into the side passages and cisterns of the watergate, butchering the cultists who had limped or crawled into cover after the first attack.  The third wave went in, under Major Rawne. In the front rank was Bragg, his empty launcher discarded in favour of the heavy bolter that he had liberated from its mounting back on Blackshard and now lugged around like a smaller man might heft a heavy rifle.  Gaunt leapt forward too, bolt pistol in one hand, chain sword in the other. He bellowed after his attacking men, all of them racing silhouettes backlit against the glittering water by fire. Milo sprang up, fumbling with the Tanith pipes under his arm.  Now would be a good time, Brin, Gaunt said. Milo found the mouthpiece, inflated the bag and began to keen an old battle lament of Tanith, The Dark Path of the Forest.  Up in the chute, Orcha and his squad heard the shrill wail of the pipes outside. Damp darkness was before them. Close up, Orcha snapped into his micro-bead. Aye. To your left, Brith yelled suddenly. An assault cannon raged out of the darkness of a side chute. Brith, Orcha and two others disintegrated instantly into red mist and flesh pulp.  Troopers Gades and Caffran ducked back behind the buttress work of the huge vault. Enemy fire! Caffran yelled into his bead. They have the chute covered in a killing sweep. Corbec cursed. He might have expected this. Stay down! he ordered the young Ghost over the mike as he beckoned his first two squads up the lower chute, black water swilling around their knees.  Hell of a foul place for a firefight, mourned Mad Larkin, scoping with his lasgun. Stow it, Larks, Corbec growled. Ahead they heard the nightmare chatter of the cannon, and the added rhythm of drums and guttural chants. Corbec knew Larkin was right. A tight, confined, unyielding stone tunnel was no place for a serious fight. This was a two-way massacre in the making. Theyre just trying to psyche us out, he told his Ghosts smoothly as they edged forward. What dyou know? Its working! Varl said. The drums and chanting got louder, but suddenly the cannon shut off. Its stopped, Caffran reported over the link. Corbec looked round into Larkins crazed eyes. What do you think? A trick to lure us out? Larkin sniffed the thick air. Smell that? Burning ceramite. Id wager theyve got an overheat jam. Corbec didnt answer. He cinched his bayonet onto his lasgun and charged up the slope of the chute, screaming louder and shriller than Milos pipes. In uproar, the Ghost squads followed him. Caffran and Gades joined the charge, bellowing, weapons held low as they splashed out from behind the buttress into the main vault.  Corbec leapt clear a sandbag line damming one gully and disembowelled the two cultists who were struggling to unjam the assault cannon.  Larkin dropped down on one knee in the brackish soup and popped the cover on his lasguns darkscope. Carefully selecting his expert long shots, he blasted four cultists further down the chute.  Las and bolt fire slammed back at the Ghosts, dropping several of them. The charging Guardsmen met the cultist force head on in a tight, tall sub-chute, no wider than two men abreast. Bodies exploded, blasted at close range. Bayonets and blades sliced and jabbed. Corbec was in the thick of it. Already a chain sword had gashed his left hand and cost him a finger, and blood blurted from a slash to his shoulder. He speared a man, but lost his gun when the corpses weight on the bayonet tore it out of his hands. He ripped out his fallback weapons, a laspistol and his Tanith knife of sheer silver. Around him in the frenzy,men killed or died in a confined press that was packed in close like a busy work transit, crowded at rush hour. Already the water level was rising because of the depth of bodies and body parts in the gully.  Corbec shot a cultist through the head as he was charged, and then lashed sideways with the silver blade, opening a throat.  For Tanith! First and Last and Only! he screamed. Advancing up the tunnel fifty paces back, Gaunt could hear the sheer tumult of the nightmarish close-quarters fight in the chute. He looked down and saw that the trickle of Bokore River water that ran down over his boots was thick and red.  Ten yards further, he found Trooper Gades, part of Orchas original squad. The boy had lost his legs to a chainsword and the water had carried his twitching form back down the smooth slope of the channel.  Medic! Dorden! To me! Gaunt bellow, cradling the coughing, gagging Gades in his arms. Gades looked up at his commissar. A real close fight, so it is, he said with remarkable clarity, packed in like fish in a can. The Ghosts will make ghosts tonight. Then he coughed again. Bloody matter vomited from his mouth and he was gone. Gaunt stood. Milo had faltered, looking down at Gades stricken, miserable death. Play up! urged Gaunt, and turned to shout down the chute to the Ghost main force in the bulrushes. Advance! Narrow file! For the Emperor and the glory of Tanith! With a deafening bellow, Gaunts Ghosts charged forward en masse, breaking down into files of three, surging into the throttling entrance to hell.  Up ahead, in the dark, close, smoky killing zone, Rawne slumped against a buttress, splashed in gore, and panted. By his side, Larkin squatted and fired shot after shot into the darkness. Corbec suddenly loomed out of the smoke, a terrible apparition drenched in blood. Back! he hissed. Back down the chute! Sound the retreat! What is it? Rawne said. Whats that rumbling? Larkin asked, distracted, pressing his ear to the stone work. Whole tunnel is vibrating! Water, Corbec said grimly. Theyve opened the sluices. Theyre going to wash us out! The cultists were everywhere. Sergeant Cluggans secondary expedition force poured in through the stinking crypts of the western sanitation outfalls, and the enemy rose to meet them all around. It was hand to hand, each step of the way won by strength and keen blades. The dark, tight confines of the drainage tunnels were lit by the flashes of lasfire, and shots ricocheted from the roof and walls.  What the hell is that smell? Forbin wailed, blasting away down an airless cavity with his lasgun. What do you think? This is the main sewage drain, Brodd snapped, a one-eyed man in his fifties years. Notice how the others get the nice clean watergate.  Keep it together! Cluggan snarled, firing in a wide sweep and cutting down a trio of attacking cultists. Forget the smell. Its always been a dirty job. More, heavy fire came their way. Forbin lost his left arm and then the side of his head. Cluggan, Brodd and the others returned fire in the close channel. Cluggan eyed the cultist troops they cut through: bloated, twisted men in robes that had been white silk before they had been dyed in vats of blood. They had come from off-world, part of the vast host of Chaos cultists that had descended like locusts onto Voltemand and destroyed its people. The sigils and runes of the blasphemy Khorne were cut into the flesh of their brows and cheeks. They were well equipped, with bolters and lasguns, and armoured. Cluggan hoped to the sweet, dead gods of Tanith that his commissar was faring better.  The Ghosts staggered and stumbled back from the spewing watergate, through the reed beds, towards the comparative cover of the riverbank. Enemy fire from the walls high above killed dozens, their bodies joining the hundreds swept out, swirling and turning, by the torrent of brown water roaring from the watergate.  Micro-bead traffic was frantic with cross-chatter and desperately confused calls. Despite their discipline, the madness of the flight from the water had broken Gaunts main force into a ragged jumble, scrambling for their lives.  Soaked through, furious, Gaunt found himself sheltering by some willows in a scummy river bend eighty yards from the watergate. With him were Caffran, Varl, a corporal called Meryn and two others. Gaunt cursed. Cultists he could fight World Eaters, daemons anything. Hed set square with any beast in the cosmos. But seventy million litres of water pressured down through a stone conduit May have lost as many as forty to the flood, Varl said. Hed dragged Caffran by the tunic from the water and the young man could only retch and cough.  Get a confirmed figure from the squad leaders! I dont want rumours! Gaunt snarled, then keyed his own radio link and spoke into his bead. Squad leaders! Discipline the radio traffic. I want regroup status! Corbec! Rawne! The channels crackled and a more ordered litany of units and casualties reeled in. Corbec? Gaunt asked. Im west of you, sir. On the banks. Got about ninety men with me. Corbecs voice hissed back. Assessment? Tactical? You can forget the watergate, sir. Once they realised they couldnt hold us out in a straight fight, they blew the sluices. It could run at flood for hours. By then theyll have the chute exits on the city side sewn up with emplacements, maybe even mines.  Gaunt cursed again. He wiped a wet hand across his face. Theyd been so close and now it was all lost. Voltis would not be his.  Sir? Meryn called to him. The corporal was listening to other frequencies on his bead. Channel eighty. The word has just been given.  Gaunt crossed to him, adjusting his own setting. What? The word. Thunderhead, Meryn said, confused. Source that signal! Gaunt snapped, If someone thinks thats a joke, Ill  He got no further. The blast was so loud, it almost went beyond sound. The Shockwave mashed into them, chopping the water like a white squall. A kilometre away, a hundred metre section of the curtain wall blew out, ripping a vast wound in the citys flank, burning, raw, exposed.  The channels went mad with frenzied calls and whoops. Gaunt looked on in disbelief. Corbecs voice cut through, person to person on the link. Its Cluggan, sir! The old bastard got his boys into the sanitation outfalls and they managed to dump all of their high-ex into a treatment cistern under the walls. Blew the crap out of the cultists. So I saw, colonel, Gaunt said wryly. I mean it literally, sir, Corbec crackled innocuously. It was Cluggan sent the signal. We may have lost the fight to take the watergate, but Cluggan has won us the battle!  Gaunt slumped back against a tree bole, up to his waist in the stinking river. Around him the men were laughing and cheering.  Exhaustion swept over him. And then he too began to laugh. General Sturm took breakfast at nine. The stewards served him toasted black bread, sausage and coffee. He read a stack of data-slates as he ate, and the message-caster on the sideboard behind him chattered and dealt out a stream of orbital deployment updates.  Good news, said Gilbear, entering with a coffee and a message slate in hand. The best, in fact. Seems your gamble paid off. These Ghost fellows have taken Voltis. Broken it wide out. Our attack units followed them in en masse. Colonel Maglin says the city will be cleansed by nightfall. Sturm dabbed his mouth with a serviette. Send transmissions of congratulation and encouragement to Maglin and to Gaunts mob. Where are they now? Gilbear eyed his slate and helped himself to a sausage from the dish. Seems theyve pulled out, moving back to Pavis Crossroads along the eastern side of the Bokore Valley.  Sturm set down his silver cutlery and started to type into his memo-slate. The greater half of our work here is accomplished, thanks to Gaunt, he told the intrigued Gilbear. Now we thank him. Send these orders under extreme encryption to the CO. of the Ketzok Basilisks at Pavis. Without delay, Gilbear. Gilbear took the slate. I say he began. Sturm fixed him with a stare. There are dangerous cultist units fleeing along the eastern side of the valley, arent there, Gilbear? Why, youve just read me the intelligence reports that confirm it. Gilbear began to grin. So I did, sir. Colonel Ortiz snatched the radio from his com-officer and yelled. This is Ortiz! Yes! I know, but I expressly query the last orders we received. I realise that, but I dont care! No, I-Listen to me! Oh, general! Yes, I I see. I see, sir. No, sir. Not for a moment. Of course for the glory of the Emperor. Sir. Ortiz out. He sank back against the metal flank of his Basilisk. Make the guns ready, he told his officers. In the name of the Emperor, make them ready.  The guns had been silent for ten hours. Ortiz hoped he would never hear them blaze again. Dawn frosted the horizon with light. Down in the valley, and in the Blueblood emplacements, victory celebrations continued with abandon. Dorentz ran over to Ortiz and shook him. Look, sir! he babbled. Look! Men were coming up the Metis Road out of the valley towards them, tired men, weary men, filthy men, walking slowly, carrying their dead and wounded. They were a straggled column that disappeared back into the morning mist. In the name of mercy Ortiz stammered. All around, shocked, silent Basilisk crew were leaping down from their machines and going to meet the battered men, supporting them, helping them, or simply staring in appalled disbelief.  Ortiz walked over to meet the arrival. He saw the tall figure in the long coat, now ragged, striding wearily out of the mist. Ibram Gaunt was half-carrying a young Ghost whose head was a bloody mess of bandages. He stopped in front of Ortiz and let medics take the wounded Ghost from him. I want Ortiz began. Gaunts fist silenced him. Hes here, Gilbear said with an insouciant smirk. Sturm got to his feet and straightened his jacket. Bring him in, he said. Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt marched into the study. He stood, glowering at Sturm and hisadjutant. Gaunt! Sturm said. You opened the way for the Royal Volpone. Good show! I hear Chanthar turned a melta on himself. He paused and absently tapped at a data-slate on his desk. But then this business with whats-hisname? Ortega, sir, Gilbear said helpfully. Ortiz, Gaunt corrected. The Ketzok fellow. Striking a fellow officer. Thats a shooting offence, and you know it, Gaunt. Wont have it, not in this army. No, sir. Gaunt breathed deeply. Despite knowing our position, and line of retreat, the artillery unit pounded the eastern flanks of the Bokore Valley for six hours straight. They call the phenomenon friendly fire, but I can tell you when youre in the target zone with nothing but twigs and dust for cover, its nothing like friendly. Host nearly three hundred men, another two hundred injured. Amongst the dead was Sergeant Cluggan, who had led the second prong of my assault and whose actions had actually won us the city.  Bad show indeed, Sturm admitted, but you must learn to expect this kind of loss, Gaunt. This is war. He tossed the data-slate aside. Now this hitting business. Chain of command and all that. My hands are tied. Its to be a court martial.  Gaunt was level and unblinking. If youre going to shoot me for it, get on with it. I struck Ortiz in the heat of the moment. In hindsight, I realise he was probably following orders. Some damn fool orders from HQ. Now look, you jumped up Gilbear began, stepping forward. Would you like me to demonstrate what I did to Ortiz? Gaunt asked the bigger man acidly. Silence, both of you! snarled Sturm. Commissar Gaunt Colonel- commissar I take my duty seriously, and that duty is to enforce the discipline and rule of Warmaster Macaroth, and through him the beloved Emperor himself, strictly and absolutely. The Imperial Guard is based upon the towering principles of respect, authority, unswerving loyalty and total obedience. Any aberration, even from a officer of your stature, is to be What the hell is that  noise? He crossed to the window. What he saw made him gawp speechlessly. The Basilisk tank thundering up the drive was dragging part of the main gate after it and scattering gaudcocks and drilling Bluebloods indiscriminately in its path. It slewed to a halt on the front lawn, demolishing an ornamental fountain in a spray of water and stone. A powerful man in the uniform of a Serpent colonel leapt down and strode for the main entrance to the house. His face was set and mean, swollen with bruises down the left side. A door slammed. There was some shouting, some running footsteps. Another slamming door. Some moments later, an aide edged into the study, holding out a data-slate for Sturm. Colonel Ortiz has just filed an incident report. He suggested you saw it at once, sir. Gilbear snatched it and read it hastily. It seems that Major Ortiz wishes to make it clear he was injured by his own weapons recoil during the recent bombardment. Gilbear looked up at Sturm with a nervous laugh. That means I know what it means! Sturm snapped. The general glared at Gaunt, and Gaunt glared right back, unblinking. I think you should know, Gaunt said, low and deadly, it seems that callous murder can be committed out here in the lawless warzones, and the fact of it can be hidden by the confusion of war. You should bear that in mind, general, sir.  Sturm was lost for words for a moment. By the time he had remembered to dismiss Gaunt, the commissar had already gone.  Oh, for Feths sake, play something more cheerful, Corbec said from his troop-ship bunk, flexing his bandaged hand. He was haunted by the ghost of his missing finger. Appropriate, he thought. In the bunk below him, Milo squeezed the bladder of his pipes and made them let out a moan, a shrill, sad sigh. It echoed around the vast troop bay of the huge, ancient starship, where a thousand Tanith Ghosts were billeted in bunks. The dull rhythm of the warp engines seemed to beat in time to the wailing pipes. How about Euan Fairlows March? Milo asked. Above him, Corbec smiled, remembering the old jig, and the nights he heard it played in the taverns of Tanith Magna.  That would be very fine, he said. The energetic skip of the jig began and quickly snaked out across the iron mesh of the deck, between the aisles of bunks, around stacks of kits and camo-cloaks, through the smoky groups where men played cards or drank, over bunks where others slept or secretly gazed at portraits of women and children who were forever lost, and tried to hide their tears.  Enjoying the tune, Corbec looked up from his bunk when he heard footsteps approach down the deck-plates. He jumped up when he saw it was Gaunt. The commissar was dressed as he had first met him, fifty days before, in highwaisted dress breeches with leather braces, a sleeveless undershirt and jack boots.  Sir! Corbec said, surprised. The tune faltered, but Gaunt smiled and waved Milo on. Keep playing, lad. It does us good to hear your merrier tunes.  Gaunt sat on the edge of Milos bunk and looked up at Corbec. Voltemand is credited as a victory for the Volpone Bluebloods, he told his number two frankly. Because they seized the city. Sturm mentions our participation with commendations in his report. But this one wont win us our world.  Feth take em! spat Corbec. There will be other battles. Count on it. Im afraid I do, sir, Corbec smiled. Gaunt bent down and opened the kit-bag he was carrying. He produced a half dozen bottles of sacra. In the name of all thats good and holy! Corbec said, jumping down from his bunk. Where Im an Imperial commissar, Gaunt said. I have pull. Do you have glasses? Chuckling, Corbec pulled a stack of old shot glasses from his kit. Call Bragg over, I know he likes this stuff, Gaunt said. And Varl and Meryn. Mad Larkin. Suth. Young Caffran hells teeth, why not Major Rawne too? And one for the boy. Theres enough to share. Enough for everyone. He nodded down the companion way to the three bewildered naval officers who were approaching with a trolley laden with wooden crates.  What do we drink to? Corbec asked. To Sergeant Cluggan and his boys. To victory. And to the victories we are yet to have. Drink to revenge, too, Milo said quietly from his bunk, setting down his pipes. Gaunt grinned. Yes, that too. You know, Ive got just the treat to go with this fine brew, Corbec announced, searching his pockets. Cigars, liquorice flavour  He broke off. What he had pulled from his coat pocket had ceased to be cigars a good while before. There were a matted, frayed, waterlogged mess.  Corbec shrugged and grinned, his eyes twinkling as Gaunt and the others laughed. Ah, well, he sighed philosophically, Some you win  Heavy, spoon-billed wading birds flew west across the lines, white against the encroaching dark. In the thickets, the daytime chirruping insects gave up their pitches to the night beetles, the nocturnal crickets, the tick-flies, creatures that spiralled and swam in the light of the stove fires and filled the long hot darkness with their percussion. Other cries rolled in the sweaty air: the whoops and gurgles of unseen climbers and grazers in the swamp. The distant artillery had fallen silent.  Gaunt returned to the command shed just as the grille-shaded watch lights came on, casting their greenish glow downwards into the slush, bulls-eye covers damping their out-flung light in any direction other than down. No sense in making a long range target of the base. Furry, winged insects the size of chubby hands flew in at once to bounce persistently off the lit grilles with a dull, intermittent thok thok thok.  Gaunt took one last look around the base site, now distinguished only by the points of light: the cook-fires, stoves, watch lights and moving torches. He sighed and went inside. The command centre was long and low, with a roof of galvanised corrugate and walls of double-ply flak-board. The floor was fresh-cut local wood sawn into planks and treated with vile-smelling lacquer. Blast shutters on the windows stood half-open and the wire screens inside them were already thick with a fuzzy, quivering residue  the mangled bodies of moths and night-bugs which had thrown themselves at the mesh.  Gaunts command equipment and his duffel bags of personal effects were set off the floor on blocks of wood. Theyd been sat directly on the floor for the first two days until it was discovered that where damp didnt seep up, burrowing worms did.  He draped his coat on a wire hanger and hung it from a nail on the overhead rafter, then pulled up a camp chair and sat down heavily. Before him, block-mounted, sat a cogitator, a vox-uplink and a flat-screen mimeograph. A tech-priest had spent over an hour diligently intoning prayers of function as he made the sacred machines ready. They were still propped in their half-open wrought-iron casings to protect against the damp, and thick power feeds snaked off from them and ran from clip supports on the rafters, out of a socket-shutter and off to the distant generator. Lights and light images shimmered and flickered on glass plates glossed by condensation. Setting dials throbbed a dull orange. The vox-link made a low-level serpent hiss as it rose and fell through frequencies. Gaunt leaned forward and idly surveyed the latest information and tactical data coming through from the orbital fleet and other units. A skein of coded runes crossed and blinked on the dark glass. Quiet as nightfall, Milo entered from the ante-room. He offered a pewter beaker to his commissar. Gaunt took it with a nod, delighting at the beaded coolness of the metal.  The tech-priests got the cooling units working again just now, Milo muttered by way of explanation. For a few minutes. Its only water, but its cold. Gaunt nodded his appreciation and sipped. The water was metallic and sharp, but it was deliciously cool. There was a thump on the outside step, then a quiet knock at the door. Gaunt smiled. The thump had been deliberate, a reassuring advance warning from a man who made no sound if he did not wish to. Come in, Mkoll, Gaunt said. Mkoll entered, his lined face a little quizzical as if surprised at being recognised in advance. Patrol report, sir, he said, standing stiffly in the doorway.  Gaunt gestured him to a seat. Mkolls battledress and cloak were drenched in wet mud. Everything including his face was splattered  everything except his lasgun, miraculously clean.  Lets have it. Their positions are still far back, Mkoll began, beyond the offensive line coded alpha pink. A few forward patrols.  Trouble? The powerful, wiry man grimaced noncommittally. Nothing we couldnt handle. Ive always admired your modesty, Gaunt said, but I need to know. Mkoll screwed up his mouth and nose. We took six of them in the western swamps. No losses on our side. Gaunt nodded approval. He liked Mkoll, the Taniths finest scout. Even in a regiment of stealthers and covert warriors, Mkoll was exceptional. A woodsman back home on lost Tanith, he had reconnaissance skills that had proved themselves time and again to the Ghosts. A ghost amongst ghosts, and modest with it. He never bragged, and it was certain he had more to brag about than most.  Gaunt offered his beaker to the man. Thank you, sir, no. Mkoll looked down at his hands. Its cold, Gaunt assured him. I can tell. But no. Id rather go without something I could get used to. Gaunt shrugged and sipped again. So theyre not moving? Not yet. We sighted a Im not sure what it was, an old ruin of some kind. Mkoll rose and pointed to a position on the wall chart. Around here, far as I can tell. Could be nothing, but Id like to follow it through with a survey in the morning.  An enemy position? No, sir. Something that was already here. Youre right: deserves a look. In the morning then, Gaunt agreed. If thatll be all, sir? Dismissed, Mkoll. Ill never get the measure of him, Gaunt said to Milo after Mkoll had left. Quietest man Ive ever known. Thats what he does, isnt it, sir? Milo said. What? Quiet. THREE SOUND AND FURY  All around there was a hushing sound, as if the whole world wanted to silence him. Mkoll bellied in low amid the forest of ferns, trying to pick through the oceanic rushing sound they made as the wind stirred them. The fern growth in that part of Ramillies 268-43, flourishing on the thin, ashy soils of the longcold volcanic slopes, was feathery and fibrous, mottled stalks rough as cane rising three man-heights into swaying multi-part fronds as white as water-ice.  They reminded him of the nal-wood forests back home, when there was still a back home, the nal-woods in winter, when hed gone out logging and hunting. Frost had crusted the evergreen needles on the sighing trees then until they had tinkled like wind chimes.  Here, now, there was only the sigh, the motion of the dry ferns and the clogging dust that got into every pore and rasped the soft tissue at the back of the throat. The sunlight was bright and harsh, stabbing down through the pale, spare air out of a sky translucent blue. It made a striated web out of the ground cover under the ferns  stark sunsplashes and jagged shadows of blackness.  He crept forward twenty metres into a break of skeleton brush. His lower legs were already double-wrapped with chain-cloth to protect against the shredding thorns. He had his lasgun held to his chest on a tightly cinched strap to keep it clear of the dust but, every ten minutes or so, he checked its moving parts and cleared the dust, fern-fibres, twig-shreds and burrs that accumulated constantly.  Several cracks made him turn and freeze, sliding his gun into a firing grip between smooth, dry palms. Something was moving through the thicket to his left, cracking the occasional spent thorn underfoot.  To be fair, they were moving with extreme and trained stealth, but still their progress sounded like a careless march to Mkolls acute hearing.  Mkoll drew his knife, its long silver blade deliberately dulled with ash. He backed into a thorn stalk and moulded his body to the kinking plant. Two steps, one. He swung out, only pulling back his blade at the last moment. Trooper Dewr cried out and fell backwards, splintering dry stalks as he dropped. Mkoll was on top of him in a second, pinning his arms and pushing the blade against his neck.  Sacred Feth! You couldve killed me! Dewr barked agitatedly. Yes, I could, said Mkoll, a whisper. He relaxed his grip, rolled off and let the man rise. So could anything else out here, noise you were making. I Dewr dropped his voice suddenly. Are we alone? Mkoll didnt answer. Chances were, if anything else was out here, it would have heard Dewrs fall too. I didnt mean anything, Dewr began hoarsely, wincing as he plucked out the thorns he had fallen on. Mkoll was scanning around, his gun ready. What the feth did they teach you during basic? he whispered. Youre meant to be a scout! Dewr didnt reply. All the scouts knew Mkolls exacting standards, and knew just as well how they all failed to meet them. Dewr felt angry, in fact. During basic training, before that as a hunter in the southern gameland of Tanith Attica, hed been reckoned as a good tracker. That was why they had selected him for the scout unit when the regiment mustered, for feths sake! And this old bastard made him feel like a fool, a clumsy fool! Wordlessly, ignoring the stare he knew Dewr was boring into the back of his head, Mkoll signalled an advance, heading down the slope into the fern-choked vale.  The Tanith had arrived on Ramillies two weeks before, just in time to miss the main action. The Adeptus Astartes had cleaned out and secured the four enemy strongholds, banishing Chaos from the world. The Ghosts had assembled on the low plains near one burning fortress, seeing Space Marines, threatening bulks in the smoky distance like the giants of myth, piling the ragged corpses of slain cultists onto pyres. The air had been thick with filthy char. It seemed some small components of the enemy had fled the defeat, making into the fern forests in the north, too small and insignificant for the glorious Space Marines to waste time upon. The commissar was charged with a search and destroy detail. The Ghosts had advanced into the low hills and the dense forestation, to smoke out the last of the foe.  There were a few early successes: enclaves of cultists, some well-armed, dug into bolt-holes and lodges, making a last stand. Then, after a week, as they reached the colder, higher plateaux and the real thickness of the fern-cover, a working pattern developed. Mkoll would plan recon sweeps each day, deploying a couple of dozen scouts in a wide fan into the thickets. They would quarter each area and report back, signalling in the main Ghost forces if contact was made.  Perhaps they had become lazy, complacent. Major Rawne averred that they had silenced the last of the enemy and were now wasting their time and patience cutting deeper and deeper into the lonely territories of the hinterland. The commissar himself seemed devoted to discharging the task properly, but even he had doubled the reach and range of the scout sweeps. Another few days and they would quit, he had told Mkoll. This day, this high cold windy day, with the ever present whisper of the ferns, the scouts had gone deeper and wider into the hills. There had been no contact with anything for two whole sweeps. Mkoll sensed that less dedicated troopers like Dewr were getting slack with the routine.  But he himself had seen things that kept him sharp and made him determined to press on. Things he had reported to Gaunt to convince him to work the forests a little longer: broken paths in the vegetation; trampled areas; torn, apparently random trails in the underbrush. There was something still out here. They crossed the valley floor and came up the shaded side, where the ferns listed restlessly, like shadow-fans. Every dozen or so steps, Dewrs feet cracked a thorn or a seed case, or chinked a rock, no matter how delicately he walked. He cursed every sound. He was determined to prove his ability to Mkoll. And he had no clue how Mkoll moved so silently, like he was floating.  The ferns hissed in the wind. Mkoll stopped to check his compact chart and referred his eyes to sun and compass. Within a quarter of an hour their circuit should bring them into contact with Rafel and Waed, on a mirror sweep towards them.  Mkoll suddenly held up a hand and Dewr stopped sharp. The scout sergeant fanned his fingers twice to indicate Dewr should cover, and the other slid in low beside a thick fern stem, knelt and raised his lasgun. There was dust on the exchanger and he wiped it off. Dust in his eyes too, and he wiped them. He braced and then took aim, rolling it left and right as Mkoll advanced.  Mkoll dropped down another few metres and found another torn trail in the fem. As wide as three men walking abreast, ferns uprooted or snapped and trampled. Mkoll gingerly touched one sappy, broken twist of stalk. It was as thick as his thigh, and the bark was tough as iron. He could not have severed it this clean even with a wood axe. He checked the ground. Trample marks, deep and wide, like giant footsteps. The trail snaked away both ahead and behind as far as he could see, uneven, weaving. Mkoll raised three fingers and circled them. Dewr advanced to join him.  The younger man looked at the trail, questions in his mouth, but the look in Mkolls eyes told him not to ask them. Not to say anything. There was no sound at all except the hissing of the fronds. Dewr knelt and looked at the trail for himself. Something someone big, moving blindly. His fingers touched something buried in the ashy soil and he plucked it out. A chunk of blackened metal, part of the rim of something, large as a cupped hand. He held it out to Mkoll. The sergeant took it with genuine interest, studied it, and tucked it into his thigh pouch. He nodded a firm acknowledgement to Dewr for his sharp eyes. Dewr felt greater pride in that fleeting moment Than he had ever done in his life before. Or would again. They moved on, down the trail line, following the bent-forward fronds which indicated the direction of motion. After sixty metres, the trail veered uphill. Mkoll stopped and wiped his weapon again. A scream cut the air, as bright and sharp as a Tanith blade. They both started. It shut off abruptly, but while it lasted it had been unmistakably human. Mkoll was moving in an instant, following the source of the sound. Dewr went after him, trying to keep his hurried steps silent. They moved off the trail into the thickets. Ahead, the foliage changed. Under the crest of the slope, thicker, spined cacti grew in clusters; fibrous, gourd-like growths lined with long needles were arrayed down each seam of the plant sac. There were hundreds of the plants, some knee high, some higher and fatter than a man, a forest of needle-studded bulbs.  Another, weaker scream came, as from a man waking from a nightmare and abruptly dying away as he realised it was but a dream. And another sound, close on the heels of the scream. A hollow, plosive, spitting sound, like someone retching fruit pits from his throat.  They found Rafel crumpled amid the gourd-bulbs. A trail of blood, bright spatters on the ashy ground, showed where he had dropped and how he had crawled. Over a dozen needles, some more than a foot long, impaled him. One went through his eye into his brain. Dewr, in horror, was about to speak, but Mkoll whirled and clamped his hand over the younger mans mouth. Mkoll pointed to the nearest of the large cactus growths, indicating where a line of spines were absent, leaving only a line of sap-drooling orifices.  I say again, Trooper Rafel! What is your position? The voice crackled out of the corpses intercom. Mkoll drove himself into Dewr, knocking him aside, away from Rafel as the three bulbs nearest the body shuddered and spat spines. A salvo of those hollow spitting coughs again. Needles stabbed into Rafels corpse like arrows and bounced off the ground around them.  One went through Dewrs shin. He wanted to scream but managed to master it. The pain was sharp, then dull. His leg went cold. Mkoll rolled off him. Dewr pointed feebly at his leg, but the sergeant seemed to ignore it. He made a quick adjustment to the intercom at his collar and then reached down to Dewrs, switching it off.  Only then did he turn to the wound. He took out his knife and cut the cloth away from Dewrs shin, slicing the straps holding the chain-cloth bandages in place. The needle had passed right through the chain, directly through the eye of some links and severing others. Mkoll turned the knife round and forced the hilt into Dewrs mouth. Instinctively, Dewr bit down and Mkoll yanked the needle free. There was very little blood. That was bad. The blood was clotting and turning yellow fast and the sticky residue on the spine suggested venom. But the needle had only punctured flesh, which was good. The force of it could have shattered the shin bone.  Dewr bit hard on the hilt a while longer. As the pain ebbed, he slackened his mouth and the knife slid out down his cheek onto the ground. Mkoll rose. He would get Rafels field dressings and bind the wound. Rafel wouldnt need them now. He turned. His foot cracked a thorn on the ground. A moment of carelessness, triggered by his concern for Dewr. A bulb shuddered at the crack and spat a needle. It passed through the stock of Mkolls lasgun and the point stopped an inch from his belly.  He unfroze and breathed, then pulled it out. Mkoll crossed to Rafel and freed his field dressing pouch, pinned to his waist by another needle through the strap. He returned to Dewr and bound the wound. Dewrs head began to spin. It was an easy, fluid feeling, like his cares were ebbing away. There was a gnawing feeling in his leg and hip, but it was somehow pleasant.  Mkoll saw the vacant glaze coming over Dewrs eyes. Unceremoniously, he took another length of gauze dressing and jammed it into Dewrs mouth, taping the gag tightly in place. A delirious man may not realise the sound he is making.  He was about to lift Dewr onto his shoulder when another sound came. A ripping and crashing, distant at first, accompanied by the relentless retching spit of the bulbs as the tearing sound set them off. Something was coming, something drawn by Rafels last scream. Something gigantic. As it burst into the clearing, all of the cacti around them spontaneously shed their needles in a blitz of venomous barbs. The fusillade rattled off the metal carapace and legs. Mkoll threw himself over Dewr and they lay there, silent and still under the storm of darts.  The Chaos dreadnought came to a halt on its great hydraulic feet, sighing and hissing. There was a stench of heat and a throb of electromagnetic power that prickled the hairs on Mkolls neck. It was four metres tall, wider than three men, blackened and scorched as if it had walked through hell and back. All signs of paint or insignia had been burnt off, to bare metal in some places. A malign presence oozed from it, filling the atmosphere. Such a great machine was terrifying enough in itself, but the malevolent feeling of it Mkoll felt his gorge rise and clamped his jaws. Dewr seemed unconscious. The dreadnought took a step forward, almost tentative and dainty though the great steel hoof shook the earth as it fell and triggered another volley of spines. Its body rotated as if scanning, and it took another step. Another plankplank of rebounding spines.  It was blind. Mkoll could see that at a glance. The wounds of the Adeptus Astartes were deep and fearful across its visor. Its optical units had been blown away in some great act. Mkoll knew the semi-circle of burnt metal Dewr had found was from the recess socket of one of its eyes. It had been blundering around the fern forests for days, hunting by sound alone.  Another step. Another hiss of pistons and a growl of motivator. Another thump of footfall, and other rain of darts. It was only three metres from them now, still cranking its body around, listening. Dewr started and woke up. He saw the dreadnought  and his filmy, poisoned eyes made even greater nightmares out of the existing one. He convulsed and screamed. Despite the gauze gag, the scream was fierce and high pitched, strangulated and horrible through the choke.  Mkoll knew he had an instant to react, even as Dewr stirred. He dived aside. The dreadnought swung and targeted the source of the scream as rapidly as the plants around them did. Poison needles spat into a body that had, mere microseconds before, been incinerated by a belching plasma gun.  Needles rattled off the dreadnought again. Mkoll moved low, sliding round the bulk of the bulbs, trying to keep the listening death machine in sight. His heart was thumping. He cursed it for being so loud. Behind the next break of growth, he slid in low and checked his weapon. There were fern fronds caught in the trigger. He thought at once to pull them free and then stopped. It would make a sound, and what was the use? What good would a lasgun be against that?  He moved again, his foot skittering a stone. Needles spat ineffectually. The dreadnought began to move, following the sound, walking through rains of needles that convulsed and flew at each footfall.  Mkoll thought to run. It was blind, the plants were blind. If he could only stay silent  and that was his gift   he could slip away and take the information to Gaunt. But would they find it again? Out here, in such a wilderness? It could take weeks to relocate the dreadnought, the lives of many to neutralise it. If he could only No. Madness. Suicide. Then he heard the voice. Distant. It was Waed, calling for Rafel. He was beyond the needle bulbs, searching, querying why Rafel had stopped transmitting. In moments, surely, he would be triggering needles. Or summoning the dreadnought. Already, the blind beast had turned and begun to stride through the thicket, crushing the spitting cactus to ochre mash.  Mkoll had seconds to think. He would not lose another of his scout cadre, not like this. He took out a grenade, primed it and threw it left. The crump took out a cluster of bulbs in a spray of fire and matted fibres, and caused a flurry of spines to shoot. Mkoll then headed directly for the blast site. He slid in with his back to one of the bulbs that had triggered at the sound of the explosion. Its needle apertures were spent. He could use it as cover safely now it was unarmed.  The dreadnought was thumping his way, drawn by the sound of the grenade. Waed had fallen silent. Mkoll adjusted his gun and set it on the ground. Then he spoke. Over here, you bastard! It sounded impossibly loud. A final taunt to follow the grenade. Bulbs popped around him. But none had spines left on the sides facing him.  The dreadnought crunched into the clearing. Its left foot clinked against something in the dust. It bent to retrieve it. Mkolls lasgun. The dreadnought raised it in its bionic claws, holding the gun up to its already ruptured frontal armour as if to sniff or taste it.  Mkoll started to run. By his estimation, there were five seconds before the lasgun magazine overloaded as he had set it. He threw himself flat as it went off. Hundreds of cacti loosed needles at the roar. Then silence. With Waed, silently, Mkoll re-entered the thicket. They found the dreadnought broken open in the blackened clearing. The overload had not killed it, but it had split its armour as the towering machine had strode forward. Poison darts had done the rest, puncturing and killing the now-vulnerable once-man inside. Mkoll could see where the maddened Chaos beast-machine had strode arrogantly on for a few heavy steps after the puny laser blast. Then it had toppled, poisoned, dead.  They headed back onto the trail. Youre a fething hero! Waed said finally. How is that? A fething dreadnought, Mkoll! You killed a dreadnought! Mkoll turned and faced Waed with a look that brooked no denial.  Well tell the commissar that the area is cleared. Understood? I dont want any stupid glory. Is that clear? Waed nodded and followed his sergeant. But you killed it he ventured softly. No, I didnt. I listened and waited and was silent and when I made the opening, Ramillies did the rest. FOUR THE HOLLOWS OF HELL  Colm Corbec was sat outside his habitat unit. As regimental second officer, he was given a bivouac like Gaunts, but the commissar knew that he preferred to sleep in the open.  As Gaunt approached, he saw that Corbec was whittling a piece of bark with his Tanith knife. Gaunt slowed and watched the thick-set man. If he himself died, Gaunt mused, could Corbec hold them together? Could he lead the Ghosts with Gaunt gone?  Corbec would say no, Gaunt knew, but he was confident of Corbecs abilities. Even though he had chosen his second in command on a decision that was as simple as a flick of a coin.  Quiet night, Corbec said as Gaunt crouched next to him and his fire. So far, Gaunt replied. He watched the big mans hands play the blade over the pale wood. He knew Corbec hated the role of command, would do almost anything to distract himself. Gaunt also knew that Corbec hated ordering men to their deaths or glories. But he did it well. And he took charge when it was needed. Never more so, than on Caligula  He would be sick. Very soon, very violently. Of this sole fact, Brin Milo was absolutely sure. His stomach somersaulted as the troop-ship plunged out of the sky, and every bone in his body shook as the impossibly steep descent vibrated the sixty-tonne vessel like a childs rattle.  Count think happy thoughts distract yourself counselled a part of his mind in desperation. It wont look good if the commissars aide, the regimental piper, wonderboy and all round lucky bloody charm hurls his reconstituted freeze-dried ready-pulped food rations all over the deck.  And whatever you do, dont think about how pulpy and slimy those food rations were advised another, urgent part of his brain.  Deck? What deck? wailed another. Chuck now and itll wobble out in free fall and Shut up! Brin Milo ordered his seething imagination.  For a moment, he was calm, He breathed deeply to loosen and relax, to centre himself, as Trooper Larkin had taught him during marksman training.  Then a tiny little black-hearted voice in his head piped up: Dont worry about puking. Youll be incinerated in a hypervelocity crash-landing any second now.  Like pepper falling from a mill, thought Executive Officer Kreff, gazing down out of the vast observation blister below the prow of the escort frigate, Navarre.  Behind him, on the raised bridge, there was a murmur as the systems operators and servitors softly relayed data back and forth. Control systems hummed. The air was cool. Occasionally, the low, reverential voices of the senior helm officers would announce another order from the ships captain, who lurked alone, inscrutable, in his private strategium, an armoured dome at the heart of the bridge.  The frigates bridge was Kreffs favourite place in the universe. It was hushed like a chapel and always serene, even though it controlled a starship capable of crossing parsecs in a blink, a starship with the firepower to roast cities.  He returned to his study of the vast bright bulk of Caligula below him, plump and puffy like an orange, speckled with white-green blotches of mould.  Imperial starships hung in the blackness between it and him: some vast, grey and vaulted like cathedrals twenty kilometres long, some bloated like oceanic titans; others long, lean and angular like his own frigate. They floated in the sea of space and tiny black dots, thousands upon thousands of dots, tumbled out of them, fluttering down towards the ripe planet.  Kreff knew the dots were troop-ships: each speck was a two-hundred tonne dropcraft loaded with combat-ready troops. But they looked just like pepper ground from a mill. As if the Imperial fleet had come by to politely season Caligula.  Kreff wondered which of the pepper grains contained Commissar Gaunt. Things had certainly livened up since Gaunt had arrived: Ibram Gaunt, the notorious, decorated war hero, and the rag-tag regiment known as the Ghosts that he had salvaged from the murdered planet Tanith.  Kreff smoothed the emerald trim of his Segmentum Pacificus Fleet uniform and sighed. When he had first heard the Navarre had been assigned to Gaunts mob, he had been dismayed. But true to his track record, Gaunt had shaped the so-called Ghosts up and taken them through several courageous actions.  It had been an education having him aboard. As executive officer, the official representative of the captain in all shipboard organisational matters, hed had to mix with the Ghosts more than other Navy personnel. Hed got to know them: as well as anyone could know a band of black-haired, raucous, tattooed soldiers, the last survivors from a planet that Chaos had destroyed. Hed been almost afraid of them at first, alarmed by their fierce physicality. Kreff knew war as a silent, detached, long-distance discipline, a chess-game measured in thousands of kilometres and degrees of orbit. They knew war as a bloody, wearying, frenzied, close-up blur. Hed been invited to several dinners in the Guard mess, and spent one strange, only partially-remembered evening in the company of Corbec, the regiments colonel, a hirsute giant of a man who had, on closer inspection, a noble soul. Or so it had seemed after several bottles and hours of loose, earnest talk. They had debated the tactics of war, comparing their own schools and methods. Kreff had been dismissive of Corbecs brutal, primitive ethos, boasting of the high art that was Navy fleet warfare.  Corbec had not been insulted. Hed grinned and promised Kreff would get to fight a real war one day. The thought made Kreff smile. His eyes went back to the dots falling towards the planet and the smile faded. Now he doubted he would see either Gaunt or Corbec again. Far away, below, he could see the scorching flashes of anti-orbit guns, barking up at the fluttering pepper grains. That was a dogs life, going down there into the mouth of hell. All that noise and death and mayhem. Kreff sighed again, and felt suddenly grateful for the tranquil bridge around him. This was the only way to fight wars, he decided.  Milo opened his eyes, but it hadnt gone away. The world was still convulsing. He glanced about, down the hold of the troopship where another twenty-five Guardsmen sat rigid, clamped in place by the yellow-striped restraint rigs, their equipment shuddering in mesh packs under every seat. The air was sweet with incense, and the ship was shaking so hard that he could not read the inspirational inscriptions etched on the cabin walls. Milo heard the roaring of the outer hull, white-hot from the steep dive. What he couldnt hear was the booming cough of the anti-orbit batteries down below, welcoming them.  He glanced around for a friendly face. Hulking Bragg was gripping his restraints tight, his eyes closed. Young Trooper Caffran, only three years older than Milo, was gazing at the roof, muttering a charm or prayer. Across from him, Milo found the hard eyes of Major Rawne.  Rawne smiled and nodded his head encouragingly. Milo took a breath. Being encouraged by Major Rawne in these circumstances was like being patted on the back by the Devil at the gates of Hell.  Milo shut his eyes again. In the rear of the slender cockpit, strapped in his G-chair, Commissar Gaunt craned his neck round to see past the pilots and the astropath and look through the narrow front ports. Chart displays flickered across the thick glass and the ship was bucking wildly, but Gaunt could see the target coming up: the hive city called Nero, poking up out of the ochre soil through a caldera ninety kilometres wide, like an encrusted lump of coal set in a plump navel.  Sixty seconds to landfall, the pilot said calmly. His voice was electronically tonal as it rasped via the intercom. Gaunt pulled out his bolt pistol and cocked it. He started counting down. High above the sunken city of Nero, the troop-ships came down like bullets, scorching in out of the cloud banks. Anti-air batteries thumped the sky. Then the cotton-white clouds began to singe. The fluffy corners scorched and wilted. A dark purple stain leached into the sky, billowing through the cumulus like blood through water. Lightning fizzed and lashed. Leagues above, Kreff paused and stared. Something was discolouring the atmosphere far below. What the he began.  Weather formation! the co-pilot yelped, frantically making adjustments. Were hitting hail and lightning. Gaunt was about to query further but the shaking had increased. He glanced round at the astropath, suddenly aware that the man was uttering a low, monotone growl.  He was just in time to see the astropaths head explode. Blood and tissue painted the pilot, co-pilot, Gaunt and the entire cabin interior.  The pilot was screaming a question. It was a psychic storm, Gaunt was horribly sure. Far below them, something of unimaginable daemonic power was trying to keep them out, trying to ward off the assault with a boiling tempest of Chaos.  The ship was shaking so hard now Gaunt could no longer focus. Multiple warning nines flashed up in series across the main control display, blurring into scarlet streaks before his rattling eyes.  Something, somewhere exploded. The vibration and the shrieking didnt stop, but they changed. Milo suddenly knew that they were no longer crash diving into attack. They were simply crash-diving. He wasnt feeling sick anymore. But the wicked incincerated-in-a-hypervelocity-crashlanding-voice started to crow: I told you so.  There was impact so huge, it felt like every one of his joints had dislocated.  There was sliding sudden, shuddering, terrifying.  And finally there was roaring fire.  And, as if as an afterthought complete excruciating blackness.  Hundreds of Imperial troop-ships were already well below the cloudbank when the psychic typhoon exploded into life, and so escapedthe worst of its effects, levelling out, they descended on the massive citadel of Nero Hive like a plague of locusts. The air was thick with them, ringing with the roar of their thrusters as they banked in and settled on the wasteland outskirts of the towering black city-hive. Traceries of laser and plasma fire divided the sky in a thousand places, making it look for all the world like some insanely complex set of blueprints. Some struck landing ships which flared, fluttered and died. Flak shells sent loud, black flowers up into the air. Marauder air-support shrieked in at intervals, moving in close, low formations like meteorites hunting as a pack, strafing the ground with stitching firestorms.  Above it all, the purple sky boiled and thrashed and spat electric ribbons. At ground level, Colonel Colm Corbec of the Tanith First-and-Only led his squad down the ramp of the troop-ship and into the firezone. To either side, he could see lines of ships disgorging their troops into the field, a tide of men ten thousand strong.  They reached the first line of cover  a punctured length of pipeline running along rusted pylons  and dropped down.  Corbec took a look each way and keyed in his micro-bead comm link. Corbec to squad. Sound off. Voices chatted back along the link, responding. By Corbecs side, Trooper Larkin was cradling his lasgun and looking up at the sky with trembling fear. Oh, this is bad, he murmured. Psyker madness, very bad. We may think we had it hard at Voltis Watergate or Blackshard deadzone, but theyll seem like a stroll round the garden next to this Larks! Corbec hissed. For Feths sake, shut up! Havent you never heard of morale? Larkin turned his bony, weasel face to his senior officer and old friend in genuine surprise. Its okay, colonel! he insisted. I didnt have me comm link turned on! Nobody heard! Corbec grimaced. I heard, and youre scaring the crap out of me. They all ducked down as a swathe of autocannon fire chewed across the lines. Someone a few hundred metres away started screaming. They could hear the piercing shrieks over the roar of the storm and the landing troop-ships and the bombardment.  Just. Wheres the commissar? Corbec growled. He insisted he was going to lead us in. If he aint landed, he aint coming, Larkin said, looking up at the sky. We were the last few to make it through before that happened.  Next to Larkin, Trooper Raglon, the squads communications officer, looked up from the powerful voxcaster set. No contact from the commissars dropcraft, sir. Ive been scanning the orbital traffic and the Navy band, colonel. This filthy psyker storm took out a whole heap of troopships. Theyre still counting the crash fires. We was lucky we got down before it really started.  Corbec shivered. He didnt feel lucky. Raglon went on: Our psykers upstairs are trying to break the storm, but  But what? It looks pretty certain the commissars troop-ship was one of those vaporised in the storm. Corbec growled something indistinct. He felt cold, and could see the look on the faces of his men as the word spread down the line.  Corbec lifted his lasgun and keyed up his micro-bead. He had to rally them fast, get them moving. What are you waiting for? he bawled. Diamond formation fire-team spread! Double time! Fire at will! Advance! For the memory of Tanith! Advance! Brin Milo woke up. He was upside down, blind, suspended painfully from his restraint rig, his ribs bruised blue and a taste of blood in his mouth.  But  unless someone was about to play a really nasty trick on him  he was alive. He could hear very little. The trickle and patter of falling water. A creaking. Someone moaning softly. There was a loud bang and light flared into his dark-accustomed eyes. He smelled thermite and realised someone had just ejected the emergency hull-plates using the explosive bolts. Daylight thin, green, wet daylight  streamed in.  Braggs huge face swam up in front of Milos, upside down. Hang on, Brinny-boy, Bragg said softly. Soon have you down. He started rattling the restraints and slamming the lock handle back and forth.  The restraints abruptly stopped restraining and Milo uttered a little yelp as he dropped two and a half metres onto the sloping roof of the troop-ship.
