Wednesday night, the Wizards defeated the Detroit Pistons, 102-97, for their third win in four preseason games. The matchup essentially served as the final test for the core players before the regular season; the team hosts a Chinese Basketball League opponent Friday. With that in mind, the starters, those who remained out of foul trouble, played more than 22 minutes.

The group consisting of Wall, Bradley Beal, Austin Rivers, Markieff Morris and Jeff Green closed out the game. Wall made all five of his shots in the fourth quarter and finished with his best performance of the preseason: 32 points (12 of 23 from the floor), nine assists, five rebounds and three steals.

With four seconds remaining, Wall drilled a midrange jumper to put the Wizards ahead by five. Though Wall’s offensive excellence sealed the game, Coach Scott Brooks believes the defensive work was just as stellar.

Detroit played its starting lineup — featuring Andre Drummond, Blake Griffin and Reggie Jackson — for the first time in the preseason and although the trio reached double figures, Washington held the team to just 35.6 percent shooting.

The Miami HEAT defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 140-128 Wednesday night at AmericanAirlines Arena. Bam Adebayo led the way for the HEAT with 26 points. The game was presented by Miami Cancer Institute at Baptist Health South Florida.

While Adebayo was active from the start as usual, nothing could prepare the Pelicans for what was to come in the third quarter.

Adebayo could not be stopped in the third, as he accumulated 15 points on 7-of-8 shooting, three steals, two assists and a block in the period.

Otherwise in the contest, the 21-year-old switched well on defense and also gave Miami second-chance opportunities time and time again.

When it was all said and done, Adebayo recorded game-highs with 12 boards (five offensive), five steals and three blocks to go along with his aforementioned game-high 26 points on 11-of-17 shooting.
